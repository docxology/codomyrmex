# Codomyrmex: A Modular, Extensible Coding Workspace

This design outlines a modular, extensible coding workspace that integrates open-source tools for building, documenting, analyzing, executing, and visualizing code.

## Core Functional Modules

| Module                                       | Description                                                                 | Key Tools/Technologies                                         | Directory Path                               |
| :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Build & Code Synthesis**                   | Manages build processes and AI-powered code generation.                     | build2, OpenAI Codex                                           | [`build_synthesis/`](./build_synthesis/)     |
| **Documentation Website**                  | Generates rich, versioned documentation.                                    | Docusaurus, Material for MkDocs, Sphinx, Read the Docs         | [`documentation/`](./documentation/)         |
| **Static Analysis & Code Checking**        | Centralizes linting, security scanning, and quality metrics.                | analysis-tools.dev, SonarQube, ESLint, CodeQL                  | [`static_analysis/`](./static_analysis/)     |
| **Pattern Matching & Generation**            | Enables exhaustive, type-safe pattern matching (e.g., in TypeScript).     | ts-pattern                                                     | [`pattern_matching/`](./pattern_matching/)   |
| **Logging & Monitoring**                   | Supports structured logging across various languages.                       | SLF4J + Log4j 2 (Java), Zap (Go), Loguru (Python)              | [`logging_monitoring/`](./logging_monitoring/) |
| **Data Visualization**                     | Offers static and interactive plotting capabilities.                        | Matplotlib, Bokeh, Altair, Plotly.py                           | [`data_visualization/`](./data_visualization/) |
| **Code Execution & Sandbox**               | Provides safe, scalable online code execution for multi-language support. | Judge0                                                         | [`code_execution_sandbox/`](./code_execution_sandbox/) |
| **AI-Enhanced Code Editing**               | Embeds AI assistance directly into the developer workflow.                  | VS Code + GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Tabnine                      | [`ai_code_editing/`](./ai_code_editing/)     |

## Core Project Structure & Conventions

| Directory                                    | Purpose                                                                                                |
| :------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`template/`](./template/)                   | Contains templates for modules and common file formats (e.g., README, API specs).                      |
| [`git_operations/`](./git_operations/)       | Houses scripts, configurations, and documentation related to Git workflows and repository management.    |
| [`model_context_protocol/`](./model_context_protocol/) | Defines the schema and protocols for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs).                |
| [`environment_setup/`](./environment_setup/) | Provides scripts and documentation for setting up local and CI/CD development environments.          |
