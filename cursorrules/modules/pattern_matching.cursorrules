-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, cased/kit library, graph analysis, similarity detection algorithms, semantic search, dependency analysis.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `pattern_matching` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Pattern Matching module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for pattern analysis and data handling.
-   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for this module.
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Pattern Matching.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders, e.g., `pattern_matching/` itself if it contains Python sources directly): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.
-   `.gitignore`: Module-specific ignored files.
-   `run_codomyrmex_analysis.py`: Core pattern matching and analysis functionality.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `pattern_matching`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `pattern_matching` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for pattern configurations and analysis results.
-   **Performance**: Optimize pattern matching algorithms for large codebases and efficient analysis.
-   **Accuracy**: Ensure pattern matching provides accurate results with comprehensive coverage.
-   **Integration**: Properly integrate with cased/kit library and other analysis tools.

## 4. Testing in `pattern_matching`
-   New features (e.g., new pattern algorithms, analysis capabilities) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover various pattern matching scenarios, algorithm accuracy, and result validation.
-   Mock cased/kit components where appropriate to ensure deterministic test behavior.
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `pattern_matching/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `pattern_matching`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document pattern matching algorithms, configuration options, and interpretation of results clearly.
-   Include examples of pattern analysis output and usage scenarios.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `pattern_matching`
