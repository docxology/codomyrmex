# Cursor Rules for the cerebrum Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `cerebrum` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Provides CEREBRUM (Case-Enabled Reasoning Engine with Bayesian Representations) framework integrating symbolic case-based reasoning with Bayesian Active Inference.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, Active Inference, probabilistic modeling, linguistic case structures, type calculus.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `cerebrum` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the CEREBRUM module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for reasoning operations.
-   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for this module.
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to CEREBRUM.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `cerebrum`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `cerebrum` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for case structures and inference outputs.
-   **Mathematical Rigor**: Implement algorithms with proper numerical stability.
-   **Case Semantics**: Follow established linguistic case naming (Nominative, Accusative, etc.).
-   **Lazy Loading**: Use lazy loading for optional dependencies.
-   **Deterministic Testing**: Ensure reproducible results with fixed random seeds.

## 4. Testing in `cerebrum`
-   New features (e.g., new case types, inference methods) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover case transformations, inference accuracy, and edge cases.
-   Use fixed random seeds for reproducible tests.
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `cerebrum/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `cerebrum`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document case types, their semantics, and usage examples clearly.
-   Include mathematical notation where appropriate.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `cerebrum`
-   **Theoretical Foundation**: Changes should maintain consistency with Active Inference theory.
-   **Case Grammar**: Preserve linguistic case semantics in implementation.
-   **Performance**: Optimize Bayesian computations for real-time use cases.
-   **Extensibility**: Design for easy addition of new case types.

## 7. Final Check for `cerebrum`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that reasoning operations produce correct results.
-   Test integration with related modules like `agents`, `llm`, and `agentic_memory`.
