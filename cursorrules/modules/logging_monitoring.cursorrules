# Cursor Rules for the logging_monitoring Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `logging_monitoring` module itself (implementation and maintenance of the module) and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

**Note**: For rules about *using* the logging_monitoring module in other modules, see `cross-module/logging_monitoring.cursorrules`. This file focuses on *developing and maintaining* the logging_monitoring module itself.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Provides a centralized and configurable logging mechanism for all Codomyrmex modules. Aims for simple, flexible, and consistent recording of application events, errors, and diagnostic information.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python `logging` module, `python-dotenv` for environment variable configuration, JSON for structured logging.
-   Refer to this module's `README.md` for a comprehensive overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `logger_config.py`: Core implementation of `setup_logging()` and `get_logger()`, including the `JsonFormatter`.
-   `__init__.py`: Exports public functions from `logger_config.py`.
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, configuration, and usage examples.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for `setup_logging()` and `get_logger()`.
-   `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md`: Practical examples of different logging configurations.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Focus on preventing sensitive data leakage through logs and secure file path handling.
-   `requirements.txt`: Module-specific dependencies (though `python-dotenv` is likely a root dependency).
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation (currently minimal, but placeholder for future).
-   `tests/`: Unit tests for `logger_config.py`.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices
-   **Consistency**: Adhere strictly to the existing coding style, naming conventions (e.g., `CODOMYRMEX_` prefixed environment variables), and architectural patterns.
-   **Language Specifics (Python)**:
    -   Utilize standard Python `logging` features effectively.
    -   Ensure `python-dotenv` is used correctly for loading configurations.
    -   Handle potential `IOError` during log file setup gracefully.
-   **Dependencies**:
    -   Minimize dependencies. `python-dotenv` is essential.
    -   Changes to dependencies must be justified and added to this module's `requirements.txt` and potentially the root `requirements.txt` if globally applicable.
-   **Error Handling**:
    -   The module itself should be robust to configuration errors (e.g., invalid log levels, unwritable log files), providing clear warnings to `stderr` without crashing.
    -   The `JsonFormatter` should gracefully handle non-serializable `extra` data if this becomes an issue, though for now, it relies on input.
-   **Idempotency**: `setup_logging()` must remain idempotent.

## 4. Testing
-   New features or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by corresponding tests in `tests/unit/test_logger_config.py`.
-   Tests should cover various environment variable combinations, log output types (TEXT, JSON), and error conditions (e.g., invalid log file path).
-   Mocking `os.getenv` and file system operations will be necessary.
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions are introduced. Refer to `tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md`, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date with any changes.
-   Ensure clear and concise code comments for complex or non-obvious logic within `logger_config.py`.
-   Document any changes to environment variable names or behavior.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `logging_monitoring`
-   **Central Role**: This module is critical for the entire project. Changes must be backward compatible or clearly communicated with a migration path if unavoidable.
-   **Performance**: While not a primary concern for typical logging volumes, avoid overly complex operations in the logging path, especially in the `JsonFormatter`.
-   **Security**: Be mindful of what information is logged. Avoid logging raw sensitive data. The module itself should not introduce vulnerabilities (e.g., through insecure file handling, though standard library `FileHandler` is generally safe).
-   **Clarity of Output**: Ensure log messages are clear, and both TEXT and JSON formats are well-structured and useful.

## 7. Final Check for `logging_monitoring`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation (`README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md`) is updated.
-   Verify that all unit tests for this module pass.
-   Manually test the logging output with a simple script if significant changes are made to formatters or handlers.
