# Cursor Rules for the performance Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `performance` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: This module provides performance optimization utilities including lazy loading, caching, and monitoring across the Codomyrmex ecosystem.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, caching strategies, lazy loading, performance monitoring, memory management, benchmarking.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `performance` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Performance module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for performance monitoring and caching.
-   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for this module.
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Performance.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders, e.g., `performance/` itself if it contains Python sources directly): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.
-   `.gitignore`: Module-specific ignored files.
-   `performance_monitor.py`: Core performance monitoring functionality.
-   `cache_manager.py`: Caching system with multiple storage backends.
-   `lazy_loader.py`: Lazy loading implementation for modules and dependencies.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `performance`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `performance` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for performance metrics and cache configurations.
-   **Optimization**: Ensure performance optimizations don't compromise correctness or security.
-   **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive performance monitoring without significant overhead.
-   **Caching**: Implement intelligent caching strategies with proper invalidation.

## 4. Testing in `performance`
-   New features (e.g., new caching strategies, monitoring capabilities) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover caching behavior, lazy loading, performance monitoring, and optimization accuracy.
-   Include performance benchmarks and memory usage tests.
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `performance/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `performance`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document caching strategies, performance monitoring, and optimization techniques clearly.
-   Include examples of performance optimization and monitoring usage.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `performance`
-   **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize for minimal resource overhead in monitoring and caching.
-   **Accuracy**: Ensure performance measurements are accurate and reliable.
-   **Scalability**: Design optimizations that scale with application size and complexity.
-   **Correctness**: Maintain application correctness while improving performance.

## 7. Final Check for `performance`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that performance optimizations work correctly and improve efficiency.
-   Test integration with all modules that use performance monitoring and caching.
