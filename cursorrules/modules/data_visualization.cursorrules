# Cursor Rules for the data_visualization Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `data_visualization` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: This module provides data visualization capabilities, including static and interactive plotting for the Codomyrmex ecosystem.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, data processing, chart generation, interactive visualizations.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `data_visualization` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Data Visualization module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for data handling and visualization security.
-   `pyproject.toml`: Python dependencies (managed centrally via uv).
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Data Visualization.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders, e.g., `data_visualization/` itself if it contains Python sources directly): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.
-   `.gitignore`: Module-specific ignored files.
-   `plotter.py`: Core plotting functionality.
-   `advanced_plotter.py`: Advanced plotting capabilities.
-   `git_visualizer.py`: Git repository visualization.
-   `mermaid_generator.py`: Mermaid diagram generation.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `data_visualization`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `data_visualization` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for data structures and visualization parameters.
-   **Chart Quality**: Ensure visualizations are clear, well-labeled, and accurately represent data.
-   **Performance**: Optimize for efficient rendering and large dataset handling.
-   **Accessibility**: Consider accessibility features for visualizations where appropriate.

## 4. Testing in `data_visualization`
-   New features (e.g., new chart types, visualization formats) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover various chart types, data processing, output formats, and rendering accuracy.
-   Include visual regression testing where appropriate.
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `data_visualization/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `data_visualization`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document supported chart types, customization options, and output formats clearly.
-   Include examples of visualization usage and integration patterns.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `data_visualization`
-   **Multi-Format Support**: Support various output formats (PNG, SVG, HTML, interactive formats).
-   **Library Integration**: Properly integrate with visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Plotly, etc.).
-   **Data Privacy**: Ensure secure handling of data in visualizations.
-   **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for large datasets and complex visualizations.

## 7. Final Check for `data_visualization`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that visualizations render correctly and accurately represent data.
-   Test integration with related modules like `git_operations` and `static_analysis`.
