# Cursor Rules for the code_review Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `code_review` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: This module focuses on static analysis and code review capabilities using pyscn integration.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, pyscn, CFG analysis, APTED clone detection, cyclomatic complexity analysis, multi-language support.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `code_review` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Code Review module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for code review and vulnerability detection.
-   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for this module.
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Code Review.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders, e.g., `code_review/` itself if it contains Python sources directly): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.
-   `.gitignore`: Module-specific ignored files.
-   `code_review.py`: Core code review functionality with pyscn integration.
-   `demo_enhanced_review.py`: Demonstration and testing utilities.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `code_review`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `code_review` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for analysis configurations and results.
-   **Performance**: Optimize for high-speed analysis (100,000+ lines/sec) with parallel processing.
-   **Accuracy**: Ensure analysis provides accurate results with minimal false positives.
-   **Multi-Language**: Support comprehensive analysis across all target programming languages.

## 4. Testing in `code_review`
-   New features (e.g., new analysis algorithms, language support) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover various analysis scenarios, pyscn integration, and result validation.
-   Mock pyscn components where appropriate to ensure deterministic test behavior.
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `code_review/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `code_review`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document analysis algorithms, configuration options, and interpretation of results clearly.
-   Include examples of code review output and configuration files.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `code_review`
-   **Pyscn Integration**: Ensure proper integration with pyscn for CFG analysis, clone detection, and complexity metrics.
-   **Performance**: Maintain high-performance analysis capabilities with LSH acceleration for large codebases.
-   **Security Focus**: Prioritize security vulnerability detection and comprehensive scanning.
-   **CI/CD Integration**: Ensure compatibility with various CI/CD systems and quality gates.

## 7. Final Check for `code_review`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that code review analysis produces accurate results and integrates properly.
-   Test integration with related modules like `static_analysis` and `security_audit`.
