-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, 3D graphics libraries, AR/VR frameworks, rendering pipelines, scene management, asset loading.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `modeling_3d` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the 3D Modeling module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for 3D rendering and AR/VR operations.
-   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for this module.
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to 3D Modeling.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders, e.g., `modeling_3d/` itself if it contains Python sources directly): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.
-   `.gitignore`: Module-specific ignored files.
-   `engine_3d.py`: Core 3D engine with scene management, objects, and cameras.
-   `rendering_pipeline.py`: Advanced rendering with shaders and post-processing.
-   `ar_vr_support.py`: AR/VR/XR capabilities and session management.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `modeling_3d`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `modeling_3d` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for 3D objects, scenes, and rendering parameters.
-   **Performance**: Optimize for efficient 3D rendering and resource management.
-   **Safety**: Implement safety measures for AR/VR operations and user interaction.
-   **Compatibility**: Support multiple 3D formats and rendering backends.

## 4. Testing in `modeling_3d`
-   New features (e.g., new rendering techniques, AR/VR capabilities) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover 3D operations, rendering accuracy, AR/VR functionality, and performance.
-   Mock 3D environments where appropriate to ensure deterministic test behavior.
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `modeling_3d/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `modeling_3d`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document 3D concepts, rendering techniques, and AR/VR integration clearly.
-   Include examples of 3D modeling, rendering, and AR/VR usage.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `modeling_3d`
-   **Performance Critical**: 3D operations require careful performance optimization.
-   **Hardware Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with various hardware configurations.
-   **Safety First**: Implement safety measures for AR/VR experiences.
-   **Resource Management**: Optimize memory usage and GPU resources.

## 7. Final Check for `modeling_3d`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that 3D rendering works correctly and AR/VR functionality is safe.
-   Test integration with related modules like `data_visualization` and `physical_management`.
