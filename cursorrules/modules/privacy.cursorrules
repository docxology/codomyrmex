# Cursor Rules for the privacy Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `privacy` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Provides privacy-preserving capabilities including crumb scrubbing, mixnet routing, anonymous communication, and data minimization.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, anonymization techniques, mixnets, differential privacy, PII detection, data sanitization.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `privacy` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Privacy module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for privacy operations.
-   `pyproject.toml`: Python dependencies (managed centrally via uv).
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Privacy.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `privacy`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `privacy` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for privacy configurations and sanitized outputs.
-   **Data Minimization**: Collect and process only necessary data.
-   **PII Detection**: Implement robust PII detection across all data flows.
-   **Anonymization Strength**: Use proven anonymization techniques with measurable privacy guarantees.
-   **No Logging of Sensitive Data**: Never log PII or sensitive data, even in debug mode.

## 4. Testing in `privacy`
-   New features (e.g., new anonymization methods, PII detectors) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover PII detection accuracy, anonymization effectiveness, and edge cases.
-   Include adversarial tests attempting to re-identify anonymized data.
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `privacy/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `privacy`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document privacy techniques, configuration options, and compliance considerations clearly.
-   Include examples of data sanitization and mixnet routing usage.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `privacy`
-   **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure compatibility with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.
-   **Privacy by Default**: Default to maximum privacy protection.
-   **Reversibility**: Clearly distinguish reversible anonymization from irreversible.
-   **Integration**: Privacy controls should be applied consistently across all data flows.

## 7. Final Check for `privacy`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that privacy operations provide strong protection without data leakage.
-   Test integration with related modules like `identity`, `logging_monitoring`, and `defense`.
