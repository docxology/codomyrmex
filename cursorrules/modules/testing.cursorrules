# Cursor Rules for the testing Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `testing` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Provides testing utilities, fixtures, data factories, and test infrastructure for the Codomyrmex ecosystem.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, pytest, unittest, fixtures, real data factories, coverage tools.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `testing` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Testing module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for test data and fixtures.
-   `pyproject.toml`: Python dependencies (managed centrally via uv).
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Testing.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.
-   `conftest.py`: Shared pytest fixtures.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `testing`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `testing` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for fixtures and data factories.
-   **Isolation**: Tests must be isolated and not depend on execution order.
-   **Determinism**: Tests must be deterministic; use fixed seeds for random operations.
-   **Fast Tests**: Keep unit tests fast; use environment-gated tests for slow dependencies.
-   **Real Methods**: Always use real implementations (Zero-Mock policy).

## 4. Testing in `testing`
-   New features (e.g., new fixtures, data factories) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests.
-   Meta-testing: Test that test utilities work correctly.
-   Ensure fixtures are properly cleaned up.
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `testing/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `testing`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document available fixtures, their parameters, and usage examples.
-   Provide testing best practices and patterns.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `testing`
-   **Coverage Goals**: Aim for >80% coverage on new code.
-   **Test Data**: Never use production data in tests.
-   **Fixture Scope**: Use appropriate fixture scopes (function, module, session).
-   **Parallel Testing**: Design tests to run in parallel safely.

## 7. Final Check for `testing`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that test utilities are reliable and well-documented.
-   Test that new fixtures integrate properly with pytest.
