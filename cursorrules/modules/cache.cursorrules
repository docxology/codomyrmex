# Cursor Rules for the cache Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `cache` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Provides in-memory and distributed caching capabilities with multiple backend support, cache invalidation strategies, and TTL management.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, Redis, Memcached, in-memory caches, LRU/LFU algorithms, cache coherence protocols.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `cache` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Cache module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for cached data protection.
-   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for this module.
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Cache.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `cache`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `cache` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for cache configurations and stored values.
-   **Cache Keys**: Use consistent, namespaced cache key patterns to prevent collisions.
-   **TTL Management**: Always set appropriate TTLs; avoid indefinite caching.
-   **Cache Invalidation**: Implement proper cache invalidation on data updates.
-   **Fallback Behavior**: Handle cache misses gracefully with proper fallback to source.

## 4. Testing in `cache`
-   New features (e.g., new backends, eviction policies) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover cache operations, TTL behavior, eviction policies, and concurrent access.
-   Mock cache backends where appropriate to ensure deterministic test behavior.
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `cache/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `cache`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document caching strategies, backend configurations, and performance tuning clearly.
-   Include examples of common caching patterns.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `cache`
-   **Data Sensitivity**: Be aware of sensitive data in caches; implement encryption if needed.
-   **Cache Stampede**: Implement protection against cache stampede (thundering herd).
-   **Memory Management**: Monitor and manage cache memory consumption.
-   **Distributed Coherence**: Handle cache coherence in distributed deployments.

## 7. Final Check for `cache`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that caching operations are performant and reliable.
-   Test integration with related modules like `performance`, `database_management`, and `llm`.
