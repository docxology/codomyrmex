# Cursor Rules for the events Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `events` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Provides event-driven architecture primitives including event bus, pub/sub patterns, event sourcing, and async event handling.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, async programming, message queues, event stores, CQRS patterns.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `events` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Events module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for event handling.
-   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for this module.
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Events.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `events`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `events` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for event schemas and handlers.
-   **Event Schema Versioning**: All events should have versioned schemas for compatibility.
-   **Idempotent Handlers**: Event handlers should be idempotent for safe replay.
-   **Ordering Guarantees**: Document ordering guarantees (or lack thereof) clearly.
-   **Dead Letter Handling**: Implement proper handling for failed event processing.

## 4. Testing in `events`
-   New features (e.g., new event types, handlers) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover event publishing, subscription, handler execution, and error scenarios.
-   Test event ordering and replay behavior where applicable.
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `events/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `events`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document event types, schemas, subscription patterns, and error handling clearly.
-   Include examples of common event-driven patterns.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `events`
-   **Reliability**: Ensure at-least-once or exactly-once delivery as documented.
-   **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling of event handlers.
-   **Backpressure**: Implement backpressure handling for high-volume events.
-   **Observability**: Events should integrate with telemetry for tracing.

## 7. Final Check for `events`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that event handling is reliable and performant.
-   Test integration with related modules like `orchestrator`, `telemetry`, and `logging_monitoring`.
