# Cursor Rules for the skills Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `skills` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Provides skill definition and execution framework enabling agents to perform specialized tasks through modular, reusable skill implementations.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, skill schemas, capability detection, skill composition, execution sandboxing.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `skills` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Skills module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for skill execution.
-   `pyproject.toml`: Python dependencies (managed centrally via uv).
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Skills.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `skills`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `skills` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for skill inputs/outputs.
-   **Skill Schema**: Define clear input/output schemas for all skills.
-   **Composability**: Design skills to be composable into larger workflows.
-   **Idempotency**: Skills should be idempotent where possible.
-   **Error Handling**: Skills should handle errors gracefully and provide clear error messages.

## 4. Testing in `skills`
-   New features (e.g., new skills, execution features) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover skill execution, input validation, and error handling.
-   Use real dependencies with environment-gated tests (Zero-Mock policy).
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `skills/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `skills`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document each skill's purpose, inputs, outputs, and examples.
-   Include skill composition patterns.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `skills`
-   **Security Sandboxing**: Execute skills with appropriate isolation.
-   **Capability Discovery**: Support dynamic skill capability discovery.
-   **Versioning**: Version skills to support backward compatibility.
-   **MCP Integration**: Skills should integrate with MCP tool specification.

## 7. Final Check for `skills`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that skills execute reliably and produce expected outputs.
-   Test integration with related modules like `agents`, `orchestrator`, and `model_context_protocol`.
