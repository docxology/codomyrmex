# Cursor Rules for the auth Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `auth` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Provides authentication and authorization infrastructure including JWT tokens, OAuth2 flows, session management, and permission checking.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, JWT (PyJWT), OAuth2, session stores, RBAC/ABAC patterns.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `auth` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Auth module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Critical security considerations for authentication operations.
-   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for this module.
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Auth.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `auth`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `auth` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for tokens and permissions.
-   **Secure Defaults**: Always default to denying access; require explicit grants.
-   **Token Security**: Use short-lived tokens; implement proper token rotation.
-   **Password Handling**: Use bcrypt/argon2 for password hashing; never store plaintext.
-   **Audit Logging**: Log all authentication events for security auditing.

## 4. Testing in `auth`
-   New features (e.g., new auth flows, permission checks) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover auth flows, token validation, permission checks, and edge cases.
-   Include security-focused tests (brute force protection, token tampering, etc.).
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `auth/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `auth`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document authentication flows with sequence diagrams.
-   Provide clear integration examples for other modules.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `auth`
-   **Security Critical**: All changes require security-focused code review.
-   **Multi-Factor**: Support MFA/2FA where applicable.
-   **Session Management**: Implement secure session handling with proper expiry.
-   **OAuth Integration**: Support standard OAuth2 providers.

## 7. Final Check for `auth`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass, especially security tests.
-   Confirm that authentication flows are secure and reliable.
-   Test integration with related modules like `identity`, `api`, and `security`.
