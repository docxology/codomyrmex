# Cursor Rules for the graph_rag Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `graph_rag` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Provides Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation combining knowledge graphs with RAG patterns for enhanced LLM context retrieval.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, graph databases (Neo4j, NetworkX), embedding models, vector stores, LLM integration.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `graph_rag` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Graph RAG module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for graph data and retrieval.
-   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for this module.
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Graph RAG.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `graph_rag`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `graph_rag` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for graph structures and retrieval results.
-   **Graph Schema**: Define and document graph schemas clearly.
-   **Embedding Consistency**: Use consistent embedding models for indexing and retrieval.
-   **Query Optimization**: Optimize graph traversal queries for performance.
-   **Hybrid Retrieval**: Support combining vector similarity with graph structure.

## 4. Testing in `graph_rag`
-   New features (e.g., new retrieval strategies, graph patterns) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover graph construction, retrieval accuracy, and edge cases.
-   Use in-memory graph databases for unit tests.
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `graph_rag/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `graph_rag`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document graph schema, entity types, and relationship patterns.
-   Include examples of RAG workflows and query patterns.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `graph_rag`
-   **Knowledge Freshness**: Implement graph update mechanisms for current information.
-   **Context Quality**: Optimize retrieval for relevant, diverse context.
-   **Scalability**: Design for large knowledge graphs.
-   **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with LLM and agent modules.

## 7. Final Check for `graph_rag`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that retrieval produces relevant, high-quality context.
-   Test integration with related modules like `llm`, `agents`, and `agentic_memory`.
