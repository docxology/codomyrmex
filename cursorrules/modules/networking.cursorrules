# Cursor Rules for the networking Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `networking` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Provides networking utilities including HTTP clients, WebSocket support, connection pooling, and network protocol implementations.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, httpx/aiohttp, websockets, asyncio, SSL/TLS, connection management.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `networking` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Networking module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for network operations.
-   `pyproject.toml`: Python dependencies (managed centrally via uv).
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Networking.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `networking`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `networking` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for network configurations.
-   **Async-First**: Use async/await for all network I/O operations.
-   **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections where possible for efficiency.
-   **Timeouts**: Always set appropriate timeouts on network operations.
-   **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for transient failures.

## 4. Testing in `networking`
-   New features (e.g., new protocols, clients) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover connection handling, error scenarios, and edge cases.
-   Use real endpoints with environment-gated tests (Zero-Mock policy).
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `networking/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `networking`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document client configurations, timeout settings, and retry policies.
-   Include examples of common networking patterns.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `networking`
-   **Security**: Use TLS for all sensitive communications.
-   **Certificate Validation**: Properly validate SSL certificates.
-   **Resource Cleanup**: Ensure connections are properly closed.
-   **DNS**: Consider DNS caching and resolution strategies.

## 7. Final Check for `networking`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that network operations are reliable and properly handle errors.
-   Test integration with related modules like `api`, `cloud`, and `security`.
