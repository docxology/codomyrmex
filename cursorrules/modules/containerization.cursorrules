# Cursor Rules for the containerization Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `containerization` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: This module manages Docker container lifecycles and orchestration across development and production environments.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, container security scanning, performance optimization, container registries.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `containerization` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Containerization module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for container operations and image security.
-   `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for this module.
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Containerization.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders, e.g., `containerization/` itself if it contains Python sources directly): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.
-   `.gitignore`: Module-specific ignored files.
-   `docker_manager.py`: Core Docker container management functionality.
-   `kubernetes_orchestrator.py`: Kubernetes orchestration logic.
-   `container_registry.py`: Container registry management.
-   `security_scanner.py`: Container security scanning capabilities.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `containerization`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `containerization` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for container configurations and orchestration parameters.
-   **Container Security**: Implement security best practices for image building, vulnerability scanning, and runtime security.
-   **Resource Management**: Ensure proper resource limits, cleanup, and monitoring for container operations.
-   **Orchestration**: Support both Docker Compose and Kubernetes orchestration patterns.

## 4. Testing in `containerization`
-   New features (e.g., new orchestration patterns, security scanning) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover container lifecycle, orchestration scenarios, and security validations.
-   Mock Docker/Kubernetes APIs where appropriate to ensure deterministic test behavior.
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `containerization/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `containerization`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document container configurations, orchestration patterns, and security considerations clearly.
-   Include examples of Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, and deployment scenarios.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `containerization`
-   **Security First**: Container operations must prioritize security, including image scanning and secure configurations.
-   **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize container images for size, security, and performance.
-   **Multi-Platform**: Support both Docker and Kubernetes orchestration environments.
-   **Monitoring**: Integrate with monitoring systems for container health and performance.

## 7. Final Check for `containerization`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that containers build correctly and orchestration works as expected.
-   Test integration with related modules like `ci_cd_automation` and `build_synthesis`.
