# Welcome to Codomyrmex Documentation

This is the central documentation hub for the Codomyrmex project.

<!-- TODO: Flesh out this introduction. 
Key things to include:
- What is Codomyrmex? (A brief, compelling overview of the project's mission and purpose)
- Who is this documentation for? (Developers, users, contributors?)
- How is the documentation organized? (Briefly explain the main sections like Project Overview, Modules, etc.)
- How to get started with the project or find key information.
-->

## Navigating the Documentation

Use the sidebar on the left to navigate through the different sections:

- **Project Overview**: Information about contributing to Codomyrmex, our code of conduct, and licensing.
- **Modules**: Detailed documentation for each individual module within the Codomyrmex ecosystem. Each module section typically includes:
    - An overview (`README.md`)
    - API Specifications (`API_SPECIFICATION.md`)
    - MCP Tool Specifications (`MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`)
    - Usage Examples (`USAGE_EXAMPLES.md`)
    - Changelogs, Security Information, and more.
    - Detailed technical overviews and tutorials.

## Getting Started

<!-- TODO: Add a section on how to quickly get started with Codomyrmex itself, possibly linking to the `environment_setup` module documentation or a general project setup guide. -->

To get started with setting up your environment for Codomyrmex, please refer to the [Environment Setup](./modules/environment_setup/index.md) module documentation.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see our [Contributing Guidelines](./project/contributing.md) to learn how you can help.

<!-- TODO: Consider adding a "Developer Guides" section to the documentation.
This section could cover topics such as:
- How to create a new module using the `template/module_template`.
- Conventions for logging, error handling, and testing across the project.
- Explanation of the `output/` directory and how modules should manage their outputs.
- Details on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and how to define tools.
