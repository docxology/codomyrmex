# Pattern Matching - Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within the Pattern Matching module, please send an email to blanket@activeinference.institute. We take all security concerns seriously.

Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed by our team.

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within [72 hours] and provide a more detailed response outlining the next steps in handling your report.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the Pattern Matching module as distributed in the official Codomyrmex repository.

## Best Practices

When using the Pattern Matching module, please consider the following security best practices:

### API Key Management

The Pattern Matching module may use OpenAI or other LLM services for code summarization and semantic searching. Please ensure:

1. API keys are stored in `.env` files which are not committed to version control
2. Production API keys are rotated regularly
3. Keys have appropriate usage limits and restrictions

### Input Validation

The Pattern Matching module processes and analyzes code, which can lead to security issues if not properly managed:

1. Be cautious when enabling analysis on untrusted repositories
2. When using regular expressions (e.g., in the `search_text_pattern` MCP tool), be aware of potential ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks from overly complex patterns

### Output Processing

Results from code analysis should be handled securely:

1. Treat analysis outputs with appropriate caution as they may contain sensitive data from the codebase
2. Be careful when rendering analysis results in web interfaces to prevent XSS

## Updates

The Pattern Matching module is regularly maintained and updated to address security concerns as they arise. Users are encouraged to use the latest version of the module.
