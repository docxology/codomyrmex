# Environment Setup - API Specification

## Introduction

This module, `environment_setup`, primarily provides instructions and potentially scripts (like `env_checker.py`) for setting up the Codomyrmex development environment. It does not typically expose a runtime API in the traditional sense (e.g., HTTP endpoints or a library of functions for other modules to call during operation).

Its "API" can be thought of as the set of command-line interfaces or script executions it offers for environment validation or setup assistance.

## Endpoints / Functions / Interfaces

### Script: `env_checker.py` (Conceptual)

- **Description**: A Python script to check if the current environment meets all prerequisites (Python version, required tools like Git, Node.js, and optionally Graphviz, presence of key Python packages).
- **Invocation**: 
  ```bash
  python environment_setup/env_checker.py
  ```
- **Parameters/Arguments**: None explicitly defined (could be extended with flags, e.g., `--check-docs-tools`).
- **Output**:
    - Prints a summary of checks performed (e.g., Python version: OK, Node.js: FOUND, etc.).
    - Exits with status code 0 if all essential checks pass, non-zero otherwise.
- **Returns/Response**: N/A (output is to stdout/stderr).

(If other scripts or callable functions are developed within this module for setup automation or checking, they would be detailed here.)

## Data Models

N/A for this module as it doesn't primarily deal with data exchange via APIs.

## Versioning

Changes to setup scripts or instructions would be versioned along with the module itself. Script behavior should be kept backward compatible or clearly documented if breaking changes are made.
