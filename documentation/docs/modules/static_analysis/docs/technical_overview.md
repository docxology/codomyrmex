# Static Analysis - Technical Overview

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The Static Analysis module serves as a centralized hub for various code analysis tools within Codomyrmex. Its primary purpose is to automate the detection of issues related to code quality, style, potential bugs, and security vulnerabilities. It aims to provide a consistent interface for running these tools across different modules and languages, and for aggregating their results.

## 2. Architecture

- **Key Components/Sub-modules**:
  - `ToolAdapterRegistry`: Manages a collection of adapters, each responsible for interfacing with a specific static analysis tool (e.g., `PylintAdapter`, `BanditAdapter`, `ESLintAdapter`).
  - `AnalysisOrchestrator`: Takes an analysis request (target paths, specific tools), invokes the relevant adapters via the `ToolAdapterRegistry`, and collects results.
  - `ConfigurationLoader`: Loads configurations for the analysis tools. This can include global configurations, project-specific configurations (e.g., `.pylintrc`), and configurations passed directly in the analysis request.
  - `ResultFormatter`: Formats the raw output from different tools into a standardized structure (e.g., a list of `AnalysisIssue` objects, or SARIF format).
  - `ReportGenerator`: (Optional) Can generate human-readable reports (e.g., HTML) from the analysis results.

- **Data Flow**:
  1. Request (API call or MCP tool invocation) is received by `AnalysisOrchestrator`.
  2. `ConfigurationLoader` loads relevant tool configurations.
  3. `AnalysisOrchestrator` identifies target files and determines which tools to run based on file types and request parameters.
  4. For each tool, the corresponding `ToolAdapter` is invoked with the target files and configuration.
  5. The `ToolAdapter` executes the external static analysis tool (e.g., runs Pylint as a subprocess).
  6. The adapter parses the tool's output.
  7. Results are passed to `ResultFormatter` to standardize them.
  8. Aggregated and formatted results are returned.

```

## 3. Design Decisions and Rationale

- **Adapter Pattern**: Using adapters for each tool allows for easy integration of new static analysis tools without modifying the core orchestration logic.
- **Standardized Result Format**: Converting tool outputs to a common format simplifies result aggregation and consumption by other modules or UIs.
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Supporting multiple levels of configuration (global, project, request-specific) provides control and adaptability.

## 4. Data Models

- **`AnalysisIssue`**: (As defined in API/MCP specs) Fields include `file_path`, `line`, `column`, `message`, `severity`, `rule_id`, `tool_id`.
- **`ToolConfiguration`**: A structure holding settings for a specific tool (e.g., enabled checks, ignore patterns).

## 5. Configuration

- Main configuration file (e.g., `static_analysis_config.yaml`) defining available tools, paths to their executables (if not on PATH), and default global settings.
- Support for standard project-level configuration files for each tool (e.g., `.pylintrc`, `eslint.config.js`).

## 6. Scalability and Performance

- Running multiple static analysis tools, especially on large codebases, can be resource-intensive.
- Adapters may run tools in parallel processes to improve performance.
- Caching of results for unchanged files could be implemented for some tools that support it.

## 7. Security Aspects

- **Tool Execution**: Care must be taken when executing external command-line tools. Input sanitization for paths and arguments is important to prevent command injection if paths are user-influenced (though typically they come from the project structure).
- **Configuration Integrity**: Malicious configurations for underlying tools could potentially disable security checks or execute arbitrary code if the tool supports such directives. Configuration sources should be trusted.

## 8. Future Development / Roadmap

- Integration with more diverse static analysis tools (e.g., for other languages, IaC tools).
- Support for auto-fixing of reported issues where tools provide this capability.
- More sophisticated report generation and visualization.
- Baseline feature: ignore issues present in a baseline report, only show new issues.
