# Security Policy for Static Analysis Module

This document outlines security procedures and policies for the Static Analysis module.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this module, or a vulnerability in one of the integrated static analysis tools that is exposed or exacerbated by this module, please report it to us as soon as possible.

**DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please email `project-security@example.com` with the subject line: "SECURITY Vulnerability Report: Static Analysis - [Brief Description]".
(Note: Replace `project-security@example.com` with the actual project security contact.)

Please include:
- Description of the vulnerability and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Affected version(s) of this module and any relevant underlying tools.

We aim to acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.

## Security Updates

Security patches for this module, or updates to bundled/recommended versions of underlying tools due to their own vulnerabilities, will be documented in the [Changelog](./changelog.md).

## Scope

This policy applies to the `Static Analysis` module itself. Vulnerabilities in the third-party tools it integrates should primarily be reported to the maintainers of those tools, though we appreciate being informed if our module's usage pattern is relevant.

## Best Practices for Using This Module

- **Keep Underlying Tools Updated**: Ensure that the static analysis tools (linters, scanners) managed or invoked by this module are kept up to date with their latest security patches.
- **Review Configurations**: Regularly review the configurations of static analysis tools. Overly permissive rules or disabled security checks can undermine the module's effectiveness.
- **Understand Tool Limitations**: Static analysis is not a silver bullet. Be aware of the types of vulnerabilities each tool can and cannot detect.
- **Manage Secrets for External Services**: If connecting to external analysis services (e.g., commercial SAST platforms), ensure API keys or credentials are securely managed, ideally through the `environment_setup` module's mechanisms.

Thank you for helping keep Codomyrmex and the Static Analysis module secure.
