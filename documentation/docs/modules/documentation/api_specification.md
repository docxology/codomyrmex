# Documentation Module - API Specification

## Introduction

This document describes any APIs provided by the `documentation` module itself (e.g., for programmatic management of documentation content or build processes). Currently, this module primarily focuses on the Docusaurus setup and content aggregation, and does not expose its own external API endpoints beyond the Docusaurus build and serve commands.

If specific APIs for documentation management are developed within this module, they will be detailed here.

## Endpoints / Functions / Interfaces

(No specific application APIs are defined for this module at this time.)

<!--
### Example: `trigger_doc_rebuild()`

- **Description**: Programmatically triggers a rebuild of the Docusaurus documentation.
- **Method**: POST
- **Path**: `/api/docs/rebuild` (hypothetical)
- **Parameters/Arguments**: None

        }
        ```
    - **Error (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error)**:

        }
        ```

## Versioning

(If an API were exposed, its versioning strategy would be detailed here.)
