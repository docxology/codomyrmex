# Build Synthesis - Technical Overview

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The Build Synthesis module standardizes and automates the process of building various components of the Codomyrmex project. It aims to provide a consistent interface for developers and CI/CD systems to compile code, package artifacts (e.g., Python wheels, Docker images, web application bundles), and manage build dependencies across diverse modules with different technology stacks.

## 2. Architecture

- **Key Components**:
  - `BuildDefinitionParser`: Reads build configurations for each module. This could be from dedicated files (e.g., `build.yaml` in each module) or by interpreting existing build files like `Makefile`, `package.json` (scripts section), `Dockerfile`.
  - `BuildPlanner`: Determines the sequence of build steps, resolves inter-module dependencies if any build depends on artifacts from another.
  - `ToolchainManager`: Identifies and invokes the correct build tools (e.g., `docker build`, `python -m build`, `npm run build`) based on the module type and build target.
  - `ArtifactRepositoryConnector`: (Optional) Interfaces with artifact storage solutions (e.g., local cache, Nexus, Artifactory, GitHub Packages) to store and retrieve build artifacts.
  - `BuildLogger`: Captures and streams build logs.

- **Data Flow**:
  1. Build request (module, target) received.
  2. `BuildDefinitionParser` loads the build instructions for the module.
  3. `BuildPlanner` identifies dependencies and steps.
  4. `ToolchainManager` executes each build step using the appropriate tools.
  5. Logs are captured by `BuildLogger`.
  6. Artifacts are produced and potentially pushed to a repository by `ArtifactRepositoryConnector`.

    G -- Logs --> H(BuildLogger);
    G -- Artifacts --> I(ArtifactRepositoryConnector);
    I -- Stores/Retrieves --> J[Artifact Repository];
    B -- Overall Status --> K[Build Result];
```

## 3. Design Decisions

- **Extensibility**: Designed to easily add support for new build tools and module types through a plugin or adapter architecture for the `ToolchainManager`.
- **Convention over Configuration**: Aims to infer build steps from common conventions (e.g., presence of a `Dockerfile` implies a Docker build target) but allows explicit configuration for complex cases.
- **Isolation**: Builds for different modules should be isolated to prevent interference, possibly using containerization for build environments.

## 4. Data Models

- `BuildJob`: Represents a single build request, its status, logs, and resulting artifacts.
- `BuildTargetDefinition`: Describes a specific way to build a module (e.g., commands, required tools, expected artifacts).

## 5. Configuration

- Global configuration for artifact repository locations, default build parameters.
- Module-level configuration files specifying build targets, commands, and dependencies.

## 6. Scalability and Performance

- Can distribute build jobs to multiple workers/agents if integrated with a CI/CD system.
- Caching of dependencies and intermediate build layers (especially for Docker) is crucial for performance.

## 7. Security Aspects

- As outlined in the main `security.md` for this module, the integrity of build scripts and dependency sources are paramount.
- Secure handling of secrets needed during the build process (e.g., for private repositories).

## 8. Future Development

- Distributed build caching.
- Enhanced inter-module build dependency management.
- Visual dashboard for build statuses and history.
