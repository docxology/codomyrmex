# Security Policy for Build Synthesis Module

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within the Build Synthesis module itself, or if its operation facilitates a vulnerability (e.g., insecure handling of build scripts leading to command injection), please report it to `project-security@example.com`.

## Security Considerations

- **Build Script Integrity**: The primary security concern is the execution of build scripts (Makefiles, Dockerfiles, package.json scripts, etc.). These scripts can contain arbitrary commands. Ensure that build definitions are sourced from trusted, reviewed locations. Avoid running builds from untrusted or modified module sources without careful inspection.
- **Dependency Management**: Builds often fetch external dependencies. This introduces risks of supply chain attacks. It is crucial to:
    - Use lockfiles (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`, `Gemfile.lock`) to pin dependency versions.
    - Fetch dependencies from trusted registries and verify their integrity if possible.
    - Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools integrated via the Static Analysis module or other means.
- **Secrets Management**: Build processes might require secrets (e.g., API keys for private registries, signing keys). These should be injected securely into the build environment (e.g., via CI/CD environment variables or a secure vault) and not hardcoded in build scripts or source code. The `environment_setup` module might provide guidance or tools for this.
- **Artifact Security**: Ensure that build artifacts are stored securely and their integrity is maintained. Consider signing artifacts.
- **Resource Consumption**: Builds can be resource-intensive. Protect against denial-of-service if the build system is exposed via an API (e.g., through rate limiting, queuing).

This module relies on the security of the underlying build tools it orchestrates. Keep those tools updated.
