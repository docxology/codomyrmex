# Security Policy for Logging & Monitoring Module

This document outlines security procedures and policies for the Logging & Monitoring module.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this module – for example, related to how log files are created/permissioned, or if log formatting could lead to injection issues (unlikely with standard Python logging but important to consider), or if any conceptual monitoring tools exposed sensitive data – please report it to us.

**DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please email `blanket@activeinference.institute` with the subject line: "SECURITY Vulnerability Report: Logging & Monitoring - [Brief Description]".

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce (e.g., specific configurations, sequence of log messages).
- Affected versions or components.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours.

## Security Updates

Security-relevant changes to the logging configuration or any monitoring tools will be noted in this module's [CHANGELOG.md](./changelog.md).

## Scope

This policy applies to the `logging_monitoring` module. It considers:
- Security of the logging configuration itself (e.g., file permissions if logging to files).
- Potential for log content to inadvertently reveal sensitive information (though the module itself doesn't control *what* is logged, only *how*).
- Security of any conceptual monitoring tools if they were to be implemented (e.g., the `query_log_summary` example in the MCP spec).

## Best Practices for Using This Module

- **Log File Permissions**: If logging to a file (`CODOMYRMEX_LOG_FILE`), ensure the application has appropriate write permissions and that the log file itself has restricted read permissions if it might contain sensitive information. The module itself does not set file permissions beyond standard OS defaults when creating a file.
- **Log Content**: Be mindful of what information is logged. Avoid logging raw sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or personally identifiable information (PII) unless absolutely necessary and properly secured (e.g., through log encryption or access controls not provided by this basic module).
- **Log Format**: While flexible, ensure custom log formats (`CODOMYRMEX_LOG_FORMAT`) do not inadvertently create parsing issues or vulnerabilities if logs are consumed by other systems.
- **Environment Variables**: Protect your `.env` file if it contains sensitive configuration details (though for this module, it's primarily paths and log levels).
- **Monitoring Tools (Conceptual)**: If any tools querying logs (like the conceptual `query_log_summary`) are implemented, ensure access to them is appropriately restricted as they could expose aggregated or detailed operational data.

Thank you for helping keep Codomyrmex and the Logging & Monitoring module secure.
