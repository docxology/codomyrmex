# examples - Functional Specification

**Version**: v0.1.0 | **Status**: Active | **Last Updated**: December 2025

## Purpose

Example documentation providing practical usage demonstrations and integration patterns for Codomyrmex platform capabilities. This documentation directory serves as a comprehensive showcase of real-world applications and implementation patterns.

The examples documentation bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application, providing working examples that users can adapt for their own projects.
