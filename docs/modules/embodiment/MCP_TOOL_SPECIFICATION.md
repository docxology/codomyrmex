# Embodiment - MCP Tool Specification

This document outlines the specification for tools within the Embodiment module that are intended to be integrated with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Current Status: No MCP Tools Defined (Archived Module)

The Embodiment module is archived and receives no further development. It previously provided physical and robotic embodiment capabilities including ROS2 bridge integration, 3D transformation utilities, sensor and actuator abstractions. This module has zero intersection with the coding platform mission and is retained only for backward compatibility.

MCP tools are typically designed for discrete, invocable actions or queries that an external agent (like an LLM) would trigger. The archived robotic embodiment mechanisms do not fit this paradigm.

No future MCP tool development is planned for this module given its archived status.

For details on the legacy embodiment functionalities, please refer to the module's `README.md` and `API_SPECIFICATION.md`.
