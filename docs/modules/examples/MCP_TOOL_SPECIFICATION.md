# Examples - MCP Tool Specification

This document outlines the specification for tools within the Examples module that are intended to be integrated with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Current Status: No MCP Tools Defined

The Examples module provides usage examples and sample code demonstrating Codomyrmex module capabilities. These are reference implementations intended for documentation and learning purposes, not for invocation as discrete MCP tools.

MCP tools are designed for actionable, invocable operations that an external agent (like an LLM) would trigger. Example code and sample scripts do not fit this paradigm as they are illustrative rather than functional.

If future enhancements introduce runnable example workflows suitable for MCP exposure (e.g., executing a curated example and returning its output), this document will be updated accordingly.

For details on available examples, please refer to the module's `README.md` and `API_SPECIFICATION.md`.
