# Cognitive Perspectives — Functional Specification

**Version**: v1.0.0 | **Status**: Active | **Last Updated**: February 2026

## Purpose

Specification for the cognitive science and engineering documentation suite. Seven essays covering information theory, stigmergy, cognitive modeling, active inference, cognitive security, ergonomics, and industrialization — each grounded in formal theoretical frameworks applied to Codomyrmex modules.

## Scope

- Signal and information theory (Shannon entropy, channel capacity)
- Multi-agent coordination (algorithmic stigmergy, GFlowNets)
- Cognitive architecture (CBR, Bayesian networks, working memory)
- Computational neuroscience (free energy principle, active inference)
- Security epistemics (cognitive threat modeling)
- Human factors (cognitive load, Fitts's Law)
- Process engineering (quality gates, SRE, assembly line)
