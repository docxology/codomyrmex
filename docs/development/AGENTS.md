# Codomyrmex Agents — docs/development

## Purpose
Developer-focused documentation coordination for Codomyrmex, providing comprehensive guides for development environment setup, documentation standards, testing strategies, and modern Python development practices.

## Active Components
- **documentation.md** - Standards and best practices for writing and maintaining Codomyrmex documentation
- **environment-setup.md** - Complete development environment configuration and setup automation
- **testing-strategy.md** - Testing approach, best practices, and comprehensive testing framework
- **uv-usage-guide.md** - Modern Python package management with UV for optimal development experience

## Operating Contracts
- Maintain alignment between code, documentation, and configured workflows.
- Ensure Model Context Protocol interfaces remain available for sibling agents.
- Record outcomes in shared telemetry and update TODO queues when necessary.
- Maintain comprehensive cross-linking between development documentation and related sections.
- Ensure development documentation reflects current best practices and real-world development patterns.

## Checkpoints
- [x] Confirm AGENTS.md reflects the current development documentation purpose and comprehensive coverage.
- [x] Verify logging and telemetry hooks for this directory's agents are properly configured.
- [x] Sync automation scripts and TODO entries after modifications to maintain development documentation consistency.
- [x] Ensure development documentation is properly linked and navigable from main documentation hubs.
- [x] Maintain consistent AGENTS.md structure with parent documentation coordination agents.
