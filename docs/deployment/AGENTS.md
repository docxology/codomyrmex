# Codomyrmex Agents — docs/deployment

## Purpose
Production deployment and operations documentation coordination for Codomyrmex, providing comprehensive guides for deploying modules and workflows in production environments with scalability, security, and reliability considerations.

## Active Components
- **production.md** - Complete production deployment guide with infrastructure setup, security configuration, monitoring, and performance optimization strategies

## Operating Contracts
- Maintain alignment between code, documentation, and configured workflows.
- Ensure Model Context Protocol interfaces remain available for sibling agents.
- Record outcomes in shared telemetry and update TODO queues when necessary.
- Maintain comprehensive cross-linking between deployment documentation and related sections.
- Ensure deployment documentation reflects current best practices and real-world deployment patterns.
