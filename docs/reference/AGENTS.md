# Codomyrmex Agents — docs/reference

## Purpose
Technical reference documentation coordination for Codomyrmex, maintaining comprehensive API references, CLI documentation, troubleshooting guides, performance optimization, and technical specifications.

## Active Components
- **api-complete.md** - **ACCURATE** API with real function signatures and working examples
- **api.md** - API index with source links and comprehensive overview
- **changelog.md** - Project change history (redirects to root changelog)
- **cli.md** - Complete command-line interface documentation
- **migration-guide.md** - Version upgrade instructions and compatibility information
- **orchestrator.md** - Workflow orchestration and system discovery guide
- **performance.md** - Performance optimization, benchmarking, and monitoring
- **troubleshooting.md** - Common issues and comprehensive solutions

## Operating Contracts
- Maintain alignment between code, documentation, and configured workflows.
- Ensure Model Context Protocol interfaces remain available for sibling agents.
- Record outcomes in shared telemetry and update TODO queues when necessary.
- Maintain comprehensive cross-linking between reference documentation and related sections.
- Ensure reference documentation reflects current APIs and accurately represents system capabilities.

## Checkpoints
- [x] Confirm AGENTS.md reflects the current reference documentation purpose and comprehensive coverage.
- [x] Verify logging and telemetry hooks for this directory's agents are properly configured.
- [x] Sync automation scripts and TODO entries after modifications to maintain reference documentation consistency.
- [x] Ensure reference documentation is properly linked and navigable from main documentation hubs.
- [x] Maintain consistent AGENTS.md structure with parent documentation coordination agents.
