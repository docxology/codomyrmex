# Codomyrmex Agents — docs

## Purpose
Central documentation coordination for the Codomyrmex project, maintaining comprehensive documentation across all areas including getting started guides, development documentation, module system documentation, integration guides, project governance, reference materials, and deployment instructions.

## Active Components
- `deployment/` – Agent surface for production deployment and operations documentation
- `development/` – Agent surface for developer-focused documentation and tooling guides
- `getting-started/` – Agent surface for user onboarding and quick start documentation
- `integration/` – Agent surface for external system integration and AI workflow documentation
- `modules/` – Agent surface for modular architecture and system design documentation
- `project/` – Agent surface for project governance, contribution, and roadmap documentation
- `reference/` – Agent surface for technical references, APIs, and troubleshooting documentation

## Operating Contracts
- Maintain alignment between code, documentation, and configured workflows.
- Ensure Model Context Protocol interfaces remain available for sibling agents.
- Record outcomes in shared telemetry and update TODO queues when necessary.
- Maintain comprehensive cross-linking between all documentation sections.
- Ensure all AGENTS.md files are consistent and up-to-date across the documentation hierarchy.

## Checkpoints
- [x] Confirm AGENTS.md reflects the current module purpose and comprehensive documentation coordination role.
- [x] Verify logging and telemetry hooks for this directory's agents are properly configured.
- [x] Sync automation scripts and TODO entries after modifications to maintain documentation consistency.
- [x] Ensure all documentation sections are properly linked and navigable from the main README and docs hub.
- [x] Maintain consistent AGENTS.md structure across all documentation subdirectories.
