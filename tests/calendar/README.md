# Codomyrmex Calendar Tests

## Overview

This directory contains the real, functional implementations and components for the `calendar` module within the Codomyrmex ecosystem. This includes `test_mcp_tools.py` for verifying the interactive agent MCP tools (`calendar_create_event`, `calendar_list_events`, etc.).

## Principles

- **Functional Integrity**: All methods and classes within this directory are designed to be fully operational and production-ready.
- **Zero-Mock Policy**: Code herein adheres to the strict Zero-Mock testing policy, ensuring all tests run against real logic. The `test_mcp_tools.py` script specifically requires the presence of the real `~/.codomyrmex/gcal_token.json` generated by the PAI Dashboard to pass.
