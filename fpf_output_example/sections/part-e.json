This codifies the empirical trend that methods which scale with **data, compute, and search breadth** outpace bespoke rule‑engineering. **Applicability:** beyond ML, this policy covers **search/optimization**, **control**, **simulation‑based inference**, and other computational sciences where capability improves with scale and exploration. When **NQD/E/E‑LOG** promotes **novelty/coverage (illumination)** telemetry into dominance (via an explicit **CAL** policy; **policy‑id recorded in SCR**), these telemetry metrics are included in BLP comparisons for the audited window.\n\n**BLP‑1 — Scale‑Audit Requirement.** Any DRR that selects a more specialized/hand‑engineered method over a general/scalable alternative **MUST** include a **Scale‑Audit**:\n* (a) **Parity harness**: same **ComparatorSet**, **freshness window**, and **evaluation seeds/replicates**; portfolio‑first evaluation (see **G.5/G.9**). Dominance criterion: **Pareto‑only** by default across the declared objective vector; any alternative requires a documented waiver by **Gov‑CAL** under **E.3** precedence.\n* (b) **Budgets**: sweep **compute** (**steps/tokens/params/time/energy**, as applicable), **data** (size/quality), and **freedom‑of‑action** (from script‑like instructions → minimal prohibitions) **under a fixed risk/safety envelope**. If any parameter cannot be swept, **pin** it and record the invariant.\n* (c) **Slopes & uncertainty**: report ∂quality/∂compute, ∂quality/∂data, and (where applicable) ∂coverage/∂**freedom‑of‑action** and **∂novelty/∂budget**; include **error bars/CI** from multi‑seed trials; publish edition pins and policy‑IDs in SCR/telemetry (**G.11**).\n* (d) **Resources**: publish **Resrc‑CAL** accounts (time/energy/FLOPs) and assurance deltas (B.3).  \n* (e) **Objective declaration**: list the **objective vector** (quality, risk, cost, **and any illumination telemetry explicitly promoted into dominance via CAL** with **policy‑id recorded in SCR**) used for Pareto comparison.\n\n**BLP‑2 — Preference Rule.** Given lawfulness and comparable assurance (within δ) and budget (within α), prefer the method whose **slope vector** is **Pareto‑dominant** over the audited range (per **BLP‑1c/1e**). If no dominance holds within error bounds, prefer the **more general** method (fewer domain‑specific heuristics, greater transfer via Bridges Φ/Ψ); otherwise resolve via **E/E‑LOG** tie‑breakers declared in policy.\n\n**BLP‑3 — Minimal‑Prescription Default.** Author **rules‑as‑prohibitions** (negative constraints) over step‑by‑step scripts. Encode limits in **Φ policy tables** (and **Φ_plane** where applicable) instead of procedural checklists; allow the agent/system to sequence functions autonomously under those constraints (SoS‑LOG). **Pre/post‑conditions and test harnesses remain permitted**; **scripts** are permissible only when mandated by safety/regulation, or with compelling evidence recorded in the DRR **and reviewed under E.3 precedence / E.5 Guard‑Rails**.\n\n**BLP‑4 — Heuristic‑Debt Register.** Any hand‑tuned rule admitted for pragmatic reasons **MUST** be registered as **Heuristic Debt** with: scope, owner, expiry/review window, measurable replacement target under BLP‑2, and a de‑hardening/sunset plan. Track in **CalibrationLedger/BCT (Baseline Change Tracker)** and cite in SCR.\n\n**BLP‑5 — Continuous‑Learning Posture.** Where product policy allows, enable **feedback‑driven adaptation** (e.g., preference learning, critique loops) within Guard‑Rails (**E.5**) and privacy/regulatory controls, with appropriate opt‑outs where required. Disabling adaptation requires DRR justification and a review date.\n\n**BLP‑6 — Precedence & Safeguards.** BLP is a **Gov/Arch** policy instantiated by Pillars **P‑10 (Open‑Ended Evolution)**, **P‑11 (SoTA Alignment)**, **P‑7 (Pragmatic Utility)**, and **P‑1 (Cognitive Elegance)**. It does **not** override safety/ethics (**E.5**) **nor** E.3 precedence rulings; where BLP conflicts with Guard‑Rails, **Guard‑Rails prevail**. When **NQD/E/E‑LOG** elevates illumination to dominance for exploration mandates, BLP **adopts that lens** rather than overriding it.\n\n*Informative SoTA contexts (post‑2015):* portfolio‑first selection across **LLM prompt‑programming vs fine‑tuned task models**; **preference‑learning families (RLHF ↔ DPO)**; **QD archives (MAP‑Elites/CMA‑ME/DQD/QDax)**; **open‑ended environment–method co‑evolution (POET‑class)**; **offline RL vs Decision Transformer parity**; and beyond ML, **optimization/control** (model‑based planning vs hand‑tuned controllers) and **simulation‑based inference** in the sciences.

This makes truncation detectable even when HTML comments are stripped or surfaced by editors. The footer marker is intentionally content‑free: **do not** place prose under it.\n\n*Note.* Pattern boundaries are still parseable by scanning for the next pattern heading (`## …`), but an explicit `:End` marker helps retrieval pipelines (and LLM prompts) distinguish “this chunk is the whole pattern” from “this chunk was cut mid‑pattern”.\n\n##### E.8:4.1.1 - Heading & ID discipline (human tooling + retrieval)\nFPF is often consumed through full‑text search and retrieval (RAG). A reader or an LLM may see a subsection without its parent headings, so headings must be **self‑identifying**.\n\n**H‑1 (Heading shape).** Every pattern heading and every subsection heading inside a pattern **SHALL** follow:\n`<hashes> <FullId> - <Title> (optional note of non‑normativity)`\n\n*Exception.* The **Footer marker** is a sentinel heading and is governed by **H‑9**, not by the standard `<FullId> - <Title>` shape.\n\n**H‑2 (Heading separator).** The canonical separator between `<FullId>` and `<Title>` is ` - ` (ASCII, space-hyphen-space).\nLegacy text may use ` - `; tooling **SHOULD** treat the two as equivalent, and authors **SHOULD** migrate to ` - ` when touching a heading.\n\n**H‑3 (FullId).** `FullId` is the full hierarchical address.\nFor a **pattern heading** it is the pattern ID (e.g., `A.2`, `E.10.D1`).\nFor **headings inside a pattern**, append dot‑separated ordinal section numbers after the colon (`:`) (e.g., `A.2:4.4`, `E.10.D2:3`).\n*Exception:* the Footer marker uses the reserved sentinel token `:End` as defined in **H‑9**.\nThe colon (`:`) is **reserved** for section paths and **MUST NOT** appear in pattern IDs.\n\n**H‑4 (Ordinals).** Ordinals in section paths **SHOULD** track the canonical template numbering (**1 = Problem frame**, …, **13 = Footer marker**) to maximise cross‑pattern comparability. During refactors or in legacy patterns, ordinals **MAY** be local. In that case, the **canonical section title at the start of `<Title>`** is the semantic key; readers and tools **MUST NOT** infer section semantics from the ordinal alone.\n*Note:* the Footer marker itself is exempt from ordinal encoding; it uses the reserved token `:End` (see **H‑9**).\n\n**H‑5 (Where kind and normativity live).** Pattern **kind** (e.g., Architectural / Definitional) **MUST** be declared in the **Header block**, not encoded into the heading text. Normativity (**normative** / **informative**) **MUST** also live in the Header block when it deviates from the default. If a reminder is needed for readers, authors **MAY** add a short parenthetical note at the end of the heading (e.g., `(informative)` / `(non‑normative)`), but headings **MUST NOT** use square‑bracket tags.\n\n**H‑6 (Heading levels).** Heading levels **MUST** preserve a fixed offset between structural layers (Part or Cluster (flat) → Pattern → Pattern sections):\n* Part and Cluster headings **MUST** use `#` (level 1) across the file.\n* A Pattern heading **MUST** use `##` (level 2).\n* Inside a pattern, each nested section **MUST** add exactly one `#` per level (e.g., `## A.2 - …`, `### A.2:2 - …`, `#### A.2:2.1 - …`).\n\n**H‑7 (Ellipsis discipline).** Authors **MUST NOT** use **three consecutive full stops/dots** (`...`) as punctuation in headings or narrative prose. Authors **MUST** use the Unicode ellipsis `…` (U+2026) instead. For editorial elisions in quotations, authors **SHOULD** prefer `[…]` to make the omission explicit and distinguish it from retrieval truncation.\n*Exception:* literal three‑dot sequences that are part of an external language’s syntax **MAY** appear **only inside code spans or fenced code blocks**.\n\n**H‑8 (Normative keywords).** The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, as clarified by RFC 8174 (only when capitalised). Authors **SHOULD** avoid informal deontic phrasing (“need to”, “is required to”) in normative clauses.\n\n**Deontics vs admissibility.** Use RFC keywords only for **deontic obligations** (requirements on authors, reviewers, implementers/tooling, or published artefacts) — i.e., things an agent can choose to do or omit. Do **not** use RFC keywords to state **definitions**, **structural invariants**, **typing rules**, or other **admissibility conditions** of the modeled world.\n\nWhen you need an enforceable constraint that is *mathematical* rather than *deontic*, express it as a non‑deontic predicate using one of: `Definition:`, `Invariant:`, or `Well‑formedness constraint:` (optionally with formal quantifiers). Prefer mathematical terms like `cardinality 1..1 (total)` / `0..1 (partial)` / `0..n` over deontic adjectives like “mandatory/optional” when the intent is cardinality, not duty.\n\n**Admissibility predicate discipline (recommended shape).**\nWhen expressing admissibility/validity constraints as predicates (`Definition:` / `Invariant:` / `Well‑formedness constraint:`):\n* Authors **MUST NOT** use RFC keywords inside the predicate block.\n* Authors **SHOULD** give each predicate a stable identifier and short name (e.g., `RA‑1 (Locality)`, `RE‑3 (Method gate)`), so that Conformance Checklist items can reference it without re‑authoring the rule.\n* Authors **SHOULD** write the constraint as a declarative predicate (optionally quantified), e.g., `role ∈ Roles(context)`, rather than as “X MUST …”.\n* If the constraint needs to be enforceable as part of a pattern’s contract, authors **SHOULD** reference the predicate identifier from the Conformance Checklist (and/or call out validator behaviour), rather than duplicating the predicate with RFC keywords.\n\n**H‑9 (Footer marker sentinel).** Footer marker **SHALL** be a single heading line whose `FullId` is the pattern ID followed by the reserved sentinel token `:End` (no ordinals, no title, no square‑bracket tags): \n`### <PatternId>:End`\nIt is the only allowed heading *inside* a pattern whose section token is non‑numeric.

        "ontology_guards": "### E.10:6 - Ontology Guards\n\n#### E.10:6.1 - Tech register ontology guards\n\n> **Purpose.** This section stabilises the Tech register of the kernel lexicon by enforcing head‑anchored naming, explicit *object‑of‑talk*, I/D/S morphology, disciplined treatment of **Role / Holder**, and Domain usage consistent with **D.CTX** and **UTS**. It aligns with **F.4 Role Description (RCS/RSG)**, **F.11 Method Quartet Harmonisation**, and **F.17 UTS**. **Scope:** Guidance is **register‑agnostic** and applies to the whole FPF; examples are illustrative and MUST pass Minimal Generality & Domain Anchoring (MG-DA) and other rules of lexical governance pattern E*. This guidance applies to kernel and non‑kernel components (including Part G and patterns in Part C) and SHOULD be reused across extensions.\n> \n**Onto1 — Head‑anchoring**  *(use Kernel heads + pass LEX.TokenClass / I/D/S gates)*\n* **Rule:** The **head noun of a term MUST explicitly signal the kind** (`System`, `Holon`, `Role`, `Work`, `Episteme`, `Tradition`, `Lineage`, `Characteristic`, `Method`, `Profile`, `Description`, `Spec`, `Flow`, `Card`, `Pack`, `Dashboard`, …).\n* **Figurative heads** with obvious overload (“Tradition”, “family”, “process”, “function”) are **forbidden in the kernel**. Use **plain twins** only with a 1:1 Tech mapping and declare **`LEX.TokenClass`** for the Tech token. They **MAY** appear **only in the Plain register** as 1:1 twin‑mappings to a Tech token, but **MUST NOT** appear in the Tech register. Plain language should minimise lexical error from overloaded terms; use plain‑twin lexical guards.\n  * **Do:** `IncidentDashboard`, `MethodSpec`, `TraditionProfile`, `FlowDescription`.\n  * **Don’t:** `IncidentBoard`, `TDD Tradition`, `Production Process` (kernel), `Service Function` (kernel).\n\n **Onto2 — I/D/S on the surface (Intension/Description/Specification morphology)**  *(ref. E.10.D2)*\n* **Rule:** Any **intensional** object is a bare head: `Method`, `Tradition`, `Characteristic`. Any **description** appends **`…Description`**: `MethodDescription`, `TraditionDescription`. Any **testable specification** appends **`…Spec`** and presupposes acceptance criteria and harnesses (normative in **E.10.D2**). E.g., *Algorithm* is a species of `MethodDescription` for a computer (a system in the role of information transformer); **If** expressed in a formal language **and** bundled with acceptance tests, it is **`MethodSpec`** (per **F.11**). **If** expressed as pseudo‑code, it is **`MethodDescription`**.\n* **Extension:** Apply the same pattern to non‑method objects where appropriate: `FlowDescription`/`FlowSpec`, `SystemDescription`/`SystemSpec`.\n* **Do:** `SamplingMethod` - `SamplingMethodDescription` - `SamplingMethodSpec`.\n* **Don’t:** `SamplingAlgorithm` (when it is just prose), `SamplingProcessSpec` (head not signalling kind).\n\n**Onto3 — Roles, Holders, and Carriers (holonic)**  *(ref. F.4 / F.5)*\n* **Rule:** The playable intention is named **`…Role`** and described through **F.4 Role Description** (RCS/RSG), e.g., `SafetyOfficerRole`, `ReviewerRole`. The party **assuming a role** is the **Holder**. Use the **`Holder#Role:Context`** pattern to type the assumption (where `Context` is a `U.BoundedContext`), e.g., `Team‑Alpha (U.Holon) is Holder#SafetyOfficerRole:Plant‑Ops`. **Carrier** is **reserved for a system that bears a symbol of episteme** (`U.Episteme`, `Tradition`, `Lineage`, `Profile`, repertoire) **independent of any concrete role assumption**, e.g., `LeanTraditionCarrier`, `CalibrationLineageCarrier`. Avoid **`Artefact`** as a head in the kernel: it is ambiguous between a Carrier (e.g., document), a system “made by” some transformer, or an episteme abstracted from its carrier.\n* **Register note:** Job titles (`Reviewer`, `Owner`, `Lead`) belong in the **Plain** register and MUST twin‑map to explicit Tech `…Role` tokens.\n* **Why:** This resolves the inconsistent “role carrier vs role holder” usage: **use “Holder” for holonic role assumption**, keep **“Carrier”** for the *system that bears a symbol of episteme*. \n* **Migration note.** Legacy `…CarrierRole` **MUST be rewritten** to `Holder#…Role:Context`. Use SCR‑LEX to enforce the rewrite.\n* **Do:** `ReviewerRole` (or `AssessorRole`), `Holder#ReviewerRole:Journal‑Issue‑42` (or `Holder#AssessorRole:Procurement‑Lot‑42`); `LeanTraditionCarrier (U.Holon)`, independent of any particular role.\n**Don’t:** `Reviewer` (as a kernel type), `ReviewerCarrier` (to mean a role holder), `SystemReviewer` (role collapsed into a type).\n\n**Onto4 — Domain only as a catalog mark**  *(ref. E.10.D1 D.CTX; publish stitching on UTS)*\n* **Rule:** `Domain` is **not a kernel kind** and carries **no semantics, inheritance, or reasoning rights**. It is a **catalog mark** that groups several `U.BoundedContext` entries.\n* **Required stitching (see D.CTX & UTS).** Any use of `Domain` **MUST** present: 1. the enumerated list of `ContextId` in **D.CTX**, and 2. the corresponding **UTS strings** (F.17) with twin labels.\n* **“Discipline ≠ Domain.”** _Domain_ labels are **catalog‑only (D.CTX + UTS)**; **Discipline** is a **CG‑Spec‑governed holon** (`U.Discipline`). Cross‑use requires **Bridge (F.9) + CL**; **LexicalCheck** MUST fail texts that equate Domain with Discipline.\n* **Governance.** **No “Domain … governance”.** Rules of comparability/aggregation belong to **Discipline/CG‑Spec** (ComparatorSet, ScaleComplianceProfile (SCP), MinimalEvidence, Γ‑fold, CL‑routing), *not* to `Domain`. Prefer `DomainFamily` + stitching over inventing new “Domain” types.\n* **Do:** `DomainBundle: ClinicalSafety → {ContextId: AdverseEvents, DeviceLabelling, …} + UTS twins`.\n* **Don’t:** `ClinicalSafetyDomain` as a type with inheritance; `Domain Governance` sections in Tech.\n\n**Onto5 — Always state the **object‑of‑talk**\n* **Rule.** The definition or first line of a gloss **MUST state what the term is about**: a `U.Holon`/`U.System`, a `U.Episteme` (`Tradition`, `Lineage`, `Profile`), a `Role`, a `Work` execution, a `Characteristic`, or a `Carrier`.\n* **Do:** “**Object‑of‑talk:** `ReviewerRole` — a role intention playable by a holon within an editorial context.”\n* **Don’t:** “Reviewer — a person who …” (blurs kind and object‑of‑talk).\n\n**Onto6 — Bans and canonical rewrites**  *(mirror E.10 § 9 L‑rules; do not duplicate tables)*\n* `process / function / activity` → **`Work` / `MethodDescription` / `Flow`** (context‑dependent).\n* `Tradition` → **`Tradition`** (Tech); leave “Tradition” only as a Plain twin with an adjacent Tech label.\n* `domain` → **`DomainFamily` + {ContextId list} + UTS twins**.\n* legacy `…CarrierRole` → **`Holder#…Role:Context`**.\n* ambiguous `Owner` in role names → prefer **`StewardRole` / `CustodianRole` / explicit responsibility head**.\n* job titles (`owner`, `lead`, `champion`) in the kernel → **use explicit `…Role` names**; keep titles in Plain with twin‑labels.\n* **Do:** `FlowDescription: ReturnsHandling`, `Tradition: Test‑Driven`, `Holder#CustodianRole:Asset‑Ledger`.\n* **Don’t:** `Returns Process`, `TDD Tradition` (kernel), `Ledger Owner` (underspecified).\n\n**Worked mini‑examples across arenas**\n1. **Software engineering:** `BuildFlowDescription`, `CIHarnessSpec`; `Holder#MaintainerRole:Repo‑X`.

Avoid `Triage Function`, `Incident Owner`.\n12. **Agriculture:** `IrrigationFlowDescription`, `SoilSamplingMethodSpec`; `Holder#FieldStewardRole:Plot‑17`. Avoid `Irrigation Process`, `Field Owner`.\n\n**Checklist before minting a KernelToken**\n* Head noun signals kind (Onto1).\n* I/D/S morphology correct (Onto2).\n* If role‑related: **Role vs Holder vs Carrier** separation observed; holonic scope explicit (Onto3).\n* Any Domain mention stitched to D.CTX and UTS; **no norms on Domain** (Onto4, Onto6).\n* Object‑of‑talk declared (Onto5).\n* SCR‑LEX rewrites checked / legacy forms migrated (Onto6).\n> **Note on registers.** Keep figurative or business‑casual terms in the **Plain** register only, with strict **twin‑label** links to the Tech token (LEX‑BUNDLE). In the **Tech** register, speak in KL‑CAL: **episteme‑about‑epistemes** (Tradition, Lineage, Profile), not in catalogue‑admin idioms.\n\n* **Onto‑Deon — Deontic lexicon guard (Core register)**  \n**Rule.** In the Conceptual Core, avoid using **“Standard”** as the head noun of an *intensional object* name unless the object is an explicit **deontic speech-act** under the **Gov** lens (cf. E.3).\n\nFor interface/boundary invariants and public commitments of **things** (holons, interfaces, ports), prefer intensional names like **InterfaceContract**, **ComplianceProfile**, **AcceptanceSpec**, **InteropProfile**, etc.\n\nUse the word **standard** for an **artefact** (Description/Specification) that is *intended to be complied with* (and that has explicit compliance checks).\n\nIf an intensional object is currently named `… Standard`, rename it to a proper intensional name, and (optionally) add a separate Description/Specification artefact that contains the standard text and the intended compliance checks.\n **Rewrite hints (Tech → Tech).**  \n `publication Standard` → `publication standard`;  \n `frame Standard` → `frame standard`;  \n `measurement Standard` → `measurement standard`;  \n `Method Interface Standard (MIC)` → `Method Interface Standard (MIS)` *(alias acceptable during transition)*;  \n `Boundary‑Inheritance Standard (BIC)` → `Boundary‑Inheritance Standard (BIS)` *(alias acceptable during transition)*.  \n **Rationale.** Keeps Core prose centred on **intensional objects** and their boundary invariants; reserves deontic obligations for governance contexts and **U.ServiceClause**‑like promises. Do **not** misuse “plane”: deontic speech‑acts are analysed via the **Gov** lens, while **ReferencePlane** remains `{world | concept | episteme}`.\n",

If a collision exists, either rename or raise a DRR to deprecate the prior token.\n**MG-DA‑T6 (Teaching swap).** In didactic prose (E.10.D2), the term can be swapped in **without caveats**. \n**MG-DA‑T7 (Intensional ground, MUST).** The definition card states the intensional criterion for membership explicitly; reviewers can check membership without reading external narrative.\n\n#### E.10:7.5 - Compatibility with USM (how tokens and scopes meet)\n**USM applies to acts, not tokens.** Mint/rename/use are **LexicalActs** that carry a USM scope. `LEX.TokenClass` constrains **where** a token may be used via an **AllowedScopes** policy:\n**Conformance rule.** For any usage `u` of a token `t`: `LEX.TokenClass(t)=c  ⇒  USM.Scope(u) ∈ AllowedScopes(c).`\n\nThe LEX registry defines `AllowedScopes(c)` (e.g., `KernelToken` usage in normative kernel constraints is allowed; in Plain register outside a glossary is restricted; Context emissions of `KernelToken` require a Bridge/alias, etc.).\n\n**Audit.** Violations are flagged as **SCR‑LEX‑Sxx** (see acceptance tests below).\n\n#### E.10:7.6 - Metaphor guidance (non‑binding heuristics)\nPrefer **object‑anchored heads** to metaphors. If a metaphor is unavoidable, ensure it is (a) explicitly defined by a pattern here, and (b) unambiguous within the **NameClass**. Example families (use sparingly):\n* **Progression metaphors** (*level, tier, ladder*): only where a **gate/upgrade** is defined by the pattern.  \n* **Separation metaphors** (*lane, track*): only where parallel, non‑interfering flows are enforced by rules.  \n* **Grouping metaphors** (*family, class*): only for **small, closed enumerations** attached to a clearly named object‑of‑talk (e.g., `SenseFamily` rather than bare *Family*).\n\n#### E.10:7.7 - Short‑form and acronym discipline\n**SF‑1 (First expansion, MUST).** On first use, expand the term; place the short‑form in parentheses (e.g., “Minimal Generality & Domain Anchoring (**MG-DA**)”).  \n**SF‑2 (Uniqueness, MUST).** Register short‑forms in the **Reserved‑Names** list; run the collision check (7.4‑MG-DA‑T5).  \n**SF‑3 (Form, SHOULD).** Prefer typographic separators (**MG-DA**) to fused acronyms (**MGDA**). Use the fused form only in code or identifiers where punctuation is disallowed, and only after registration.\n\n#### E.10:7.8 - Examples (illustrative, canonical)\nPrefer **`U.ServiceClause`** (promise) over *BusinessService*; **`U.Capability`** over *Function*; **`U.Dynamics`** over *NaturalProcess*; **`U.WorkPlan`** over *ScheduleProcess*.  \nDo **not** mint *ETLService* at kernel level—model ETL as `MethodDescription`; the **Service** is “data delivered under acceptance.”\n\n#### E.10:7.9 - Acceptance & regression checks (LEX/USM)\n**SCR‑LEX‑S01 (TokenClass declaration).** Every normative token has a declared `LEX.TokenClass`.\n**SCR‑LEX‑S02 (Collision & uniqueness).** Full‑text + Reserved‑Names check passes (no other meaning in FPF).\n**SCR‑LEX‑S03 (Object‑of‑talk anchoring).** Heads name the object classified (DA‑D1).\n**SCR‑LEX‑S04 (CharacteristicSpace).** Enumerations declare their value set and space (DA‑D2/3).\n**SCR‑LEX‑S05 (USM compatibility).** For each LexicalAct, `USM.Scope ∈ AllowedScopes(LEX.TokenClass)`.\n**SCR‑LEX‑S06 (Slot/Ref suffix discipline).** Any token with suffix **`…Slot`** or **`…Ref`** is either (a) a **SlotKind**/**RefKind** declared under A.6.5, or (b) a episteme field whose type is a RefKind; no ValueKind or other type class may end with these suffixes.\n**RSCR‑LEX‑E01 (Banned generics).** Reject tokens matching the banned combinators list (DA‑D7).\n**RSCR‑LEX‑E02 (Metaphor hygiene).** If a metaphor is used, show the pattern that defines it; otherwise rename.\n**RSCR‑LEX‑E03 (Strategy token minting).** Reject new Kernel tokens named **Strategy**/**Policy** as kinds; model them as **lenses/flows/compositions** inside **G.5** or as **…Description/…Spec** in Contexts. (Prevents kernel overloading; aligns with C.22 “no minted Strategy head”.)\n",
        "morphology_&_lexical_form_(lex.morph)": "### E.10:8 - Morphology & Lexical Form (LEX.Morph)\n\n> **Principle.** Form follows **object‑of‑talk**. A token’s morphology (suffix/prefix/casing) must (a) express **what kind of thing** it names, (b) respect **MG-DA** (Minimal Generality & Domain Anchoring), and (c) pass **LEX.TokenClass** gates:\n> `LEX.TokenClass(token) ∈ {KernelToken | ContextToken | DiscriminatorToken}`.\n> Morphological choices never override **I/D/S layers** or **CHR\\:ReferencePlane** semantics.\n\n#### E.10:8.0 - Casing & basic forms\n\n**M‑0 (Casing and categories).**\nTypes & role kinds: **UpperCamelCase** (`IncisionOperatorRole`, `MethodDescription`).\nRelations/verbs: **lowerCamelCase** (`performedBy`, `isExecutionOf`, `bindsMethod`).\nIDs/instances: **flat with delimiters** (context‑defined) but never collide with type forms (e.g., `W#Seam134`, `ctx:Hospital.OR_2025`).\n**Register discipline:** normative tokens use the Technical register;

no procedures | Kernel A.19; CHR/space consumers | `CharacteristicSpace`, `CreativitySpace`. Edition of a Space is a **phase** of the episteme that defines it. |\n| **SpaceRef** | Pointer | Registry reference to a Space | Data fields / UTS | `CharacteristicSpaceRef`. Use **`.edition`** on the **Ref** when pinning a historical phase. |\n| **Map** | Intensional kind (method) | A **mapping method** from subjects to coordinates in a declared Space (encoder/featurizer) | Kernel/Method family (I‑layer), described/spec’d via I/D/S | `DescriptorMap` (declares invariances, corpus typing). Not a record or file. |\n| **MapRef** | Pointer | Registry reference to a **Map** | Data fields / UTS | `DescriptorMapRef`. Pin the method phase via **`DescriptorMapRef.edition`**. |\n| **Def** | S‑layer alias (CG‑Spec family) | A **definition/specification artifact** that fixes a **formula** or **distance** over a space; *synonym of …Spec* **within CG‑Spec registries only** | Part G (CG‑Spec family) | `DistanceDef` ≍ `DistanceSpec`. Prefer **…Spec** in new normative prose; **…Def** retained where already published. |\n| **DefRef** | Pointer | Registry reference to a **…Spec/…Def** | Data fields / UTS | `DistanceDefRef`. Use **`DistanceDefRef.edition`** to pin the exact formula edition. |\n| **Spec** | S‑layer | Testable invariants bound to acceptance harnesses | E.10 & A.21 | For stable, testable definitions; **normative** by default; S‑layer, Spec‑gated | Use for normative calculi and scoring/normalization specifications. |\n| **Slot** | Structural position | Named **argument position** in a relation/morphism signature (SlotKind in A.6.5) | Kernel A.6.0/A.6.5 | `DescribedEntitySlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`. Always names a *position*; never used for ValueKinds or episteme fields. |\n| **Ref** | Pointer | **Reference/identifier** to a registry item of some ValueKind (RefKind in A.6.5), not the thing itself | Data fields / UTS; RefKind types | `U.EntityRef`, `U.HolonRef`; episteme fields `…Ref : U.EntityRef`. Reserved for **RefKinds** and episteme fields typed as them; `…Ref` **never** carries content and is never used for ValueKinds or SlotKinds. |\n| **Series** | Governance object | A **PhaseOf chain** (“editions”) for an episteme | Edition governance | `U.EditionSeries`. Holds immutability and provenance rules. |\n| **.edition** | Attribute (on **Ref**) | The **phase id** of the **referenced artifact**; attaches to `…Ref`, not to the artifact’s name | Data fields / UTS | Use `XRef.edition`, **not** bare `XEdition` fields. Lower camelCase for keys. |\n\n**Notes.**\n• **Kernel‑only ban list** remains in § 8.3.\n• **CHR guard:** the only token that may use the word *plane* is **CHR:ReferencePlane**.\n• **Axis/dimension metaphors** are deprecated; use **Characteristic / CharacteristicSpace** where an enumeration is intended (see § 7).\n\n**Not only suffix guard**\n* Suffixes are strongly related to kinds and **should** be clearly guarded by MG-DA.\n* Other morphemes (not only suffixes) also **must** respect kinds. For example, **Space is a geometric concept** — **never** use it as a suffix (`…Space…`) or other morpheme in beginning or in the middle of a term to name non‑geometric entities (e.g. prefer **Set/Kid/Kit** instead of **Space** where membership is intended).\n\n**L‑SURF — disciplined use of *Surface* **\n* **Definition.** *Surface* is reserved for **publication/interoperability surfaces** (UTS, shipping, interop) that present lawful, plane‑aware summaries for human/selector consumption. A **Surface is a bundle of views** (ISO 42010 sense) packaged for a stated **audience** and **purpose**, with declared **viewpoint**. Surfaces are **conceptual** (E.5.2); serialisations live in Annex/Interop. Surfaces package **D/S** projections produced via `Describe_ID` / `Specify_DS` (A.7) and do **not** change object ontology.\n* **Allowed:** `PublicationSurface`, `InteropSurface` (G.10/G.13).  \n* **Forbidden:** `StructureSurface`, `MechanismSurface`, any `…Surface` that denotes a structural, mechanistic or measurement object.  \n* **Preferred alternatives:** use `…Boundary` (structural border), `…View` (publication view), or `…Card` (UTS record).\n\n**L‑SPACE — disciplined use of *Space* **\n* Use *Space* only for **CHR‑grounded measurement/state constructs** (e.g., `CharacteristicSpace` per A.19). Do **not** coin generic `…Space` for sets/portfolios or publication artefacts. Publish portfolios/archives as **sets** via lawful selectors; surface them on UTS as **views/cards**, not as spaces. \n* **Field‑name guard (Kernel blocks).** In **Kernel conceptual blocks** (e.g., A.6.0/A.6.1 lists), **do not** name a field `…Space`; reserve *Space* to the **types** (CHR/ReferencePlane families). Use **BaseType** as the field name and let the referenced `U.Type` carry `…Space` where appropriate; otherwise, for set‑valued universes, use `…Set`.\n* Space is geomertic concept, neve use it even not as a suffix for naming non-geometric spaces (e.g. instead of Sets with membership)\n\n**L‑ROLE — disciplined use of *Role***\n* **Role** is always **Role Enactment for the `U.Holon`/`U.System` kind** (agentive use).\n* **Param‑slot / relation‑endpoint guard.** Do **not** use the morpheme **`Role`** for **formal parameter positions** in operator algebra declarations (`OperationAlgebra`) or Signature arguments. Reserve **`Role`** for **agentive kinds** only (A.2/F.4/F.6). Prefer SlotKinds + SlotSpecs (A.6.5) to type formal slots; if a didactic list is useful, use a `ValueKindView` (name→ValueKind) projection derived from SlotSpecs/SlotIndex. Same for similar situations (table columns, tuple placements): use MG-DA with domain‑**specific** terminology, never “Role”. \n\n#### E.10:8.2 - Forbidden suffixes & the DevOps, Data Governance and Repository-Workflow Lexical Firewall\n\n**M‑F (Forbidden in Kernel tokens).** In KernelToken names, do **not** use: *…Function*, *…Process*, *…Task*, *…Activity*. These are ambiguous or vacuous—map using § 6 typing rules (often to `Method`, `MethodDescription`, or `Work`).\n\n**M‑FW (Tool/file markers).** Tooling/file suffixes (*…API*, *…JSON*, *…YAML*, *…CI*, *…Kafka*, *…Postgres*) are **not** part of conceptual names. Place them in **Context** glossaries or operational configs (DevOps Lexical Firewall). Kernel names never carry tool/format/notation marks. It is pure conceptual, no data management and data governance intended.\n\n#### E.10:8.3 - Prefix discipline\n\n**M‑P1 (Reserved prefixes).** `U.` reserved for **Kernel types**; `Γ_` for algebraic operators; `CAL/LOG/CHR` for **architheory packages**. Never mint `U.*` inside a Context.\n\n**M‑P2 (Edition markers).** Apply explicit edition/version markers to **Contexts** and to `MethodDescription` / `Service`—**not** to `Method` (e.g., `BPMN_2.0_BoundedContext`, `JS_Schedule_v4_MethodDescription`, `PassportIssuanceService_v2025`).  Authors MAY annotate Context or Service names for didactics.\n**Norms (edition vs release vs version).**\n1) **edition** — the **content phase** of an episteme (Concept/Object/Symbol where Symbol‑only notation swaps do not force a phase). Lives in `U.EditionSeries`. Never embedded in labels (see R‑RD‑7); bind via data: `…Ref.edition`. \n2) **release** — a **Work** of making a **Carrier** public; may carry tags/dates; does **not** change episteme identity or phase.\n3) **version** — a **tooling/carrier** identifier (file/package/code). Use only in Tooling/Pedagogy families; not in Core names.\n\n**Property discipline.** When a field pins a referenced artifact’s phase, write it as **`<Thing>Ref.edition`** (dot notation), never as a standalone `…Edition` key. E.g., replace `DHCMethodEdition` with `DHCMethodRef.edition`.\n\n#### E.10:8.4 - Morphology tests (apply with § 7 MG-DA)\n\n**M‑1 (Slot test).** The candidate fits **one** slot in the Strict Distinction lattice (Object ≠ Description ≠ Carrier; Role ≠ Method ≠ Work). If not, **rename** or split.\n\n**M‑2 (Object‑of‑talk anchoring).** The head noun names the **object being classified** (Role/Method/Service/Work/Context/Characteristic). No free‑floating metaphors.\n\n**M‑3 (Family congruence).** Where eligibility clarity is needed, add a **Context‑specific characteristic** (RCS) as a qualifier (e.g., `NormativeStandardRole`). Do **not** fake families with bare metaphors (no `RowPlane`, `senseFamily`, `…Lane`).\n\n**M‑4 (Run vs design).** Use **`Work`** only for executions; use **`MethodDescription`** for recipes; never cross.\n\n**M‑5 (Kernel parochiality).** KernelToken names carry **no domain nouns**; push domain markers to Context or RCS.\n\n**M‑6 (Vacuity ban).** Avoid vacuous heads (*Thing, Event, Process, Resource*). Use established kernel heads (`U.Holon`, `U.Work`, `U.Method`, `U.Resrc`, …).\n\n**M‑7 (Notation independence).** Intensional meaning survives notation/tool swaps.\n\n**M‑8 (Collision & uniqueness).** Before merge, run **full‑text** + **Reserved‑Names** checks; the token must not collide with any other meaning anywhere in FPF (cf. § 7 MG-DA‑T5).\n\n#### E.10:8.5 - Alias hygiene\n\nAliases live **only** inside a **Context Glossary** and map to **one** technical label with an **equivalence** note (≡). No global aliases.\n\n#### E.10:8.6 - Compatibility with USM (acts vs tokens)\n\n**LEX applies to tokens; USM applies to acts.** Mint/rename/use are **LexicalActs** that carry a USM scope (e.g., ClaimScope, WorkScope). LEX constrains **where** a token form may appear via **AllowedScopes** policies:\n\n`LEX.TokenClass(t)=c  ⇒  USM.Scope(usage) ∈ AllowedScopes(c)`.\n\nExample: using a `KernelToken` in a Context constraint may require a Bridge/alias; logging `Work` inside a MethodDescription violates M‑4 and the policy.\n\n#### E.10:8.7 - Acceptance & regression checks (LEX/USM)\n\n* **SCR‑MOR‑S01 (Suffix whitelist).** Every normative token with a reserved suffix matches § 8.1 row semantics and passes Layer gates.\n* **SCR‑MOR‑S02 (Kernel bans).** KernelToken names contain none of the forbidden suffixes (§ 8.2).\n* **SCR‑MOR‑S03 (Prefixes).** Reserved prefixes obey § 8.3; no `U.*` minted in Context.\n* **SCR‑MOR‑S04 (Run/design gate).** `Work` appears only for executions; `MethodDescription` has no runtime actuals.\n* **SCR‑MOR‑S05 (Collision).** Full‑text + Reserved‑Names checks pass (no other sense of the token elsewhere).\n* **SCR‑MOR‑S06 (Object‑of‑talk).** Heads pass M‑2; no bare metaphors as heads.\n* **RSCR‑MOR‑E01 (DevOps firewall).** Tool/file suffixes quarantined to Context; none leak into KernelToken names.\n* **RSCR‑MOR‑E02 (USM compliance).** For each LexicalAct, verify `USM.Scope ∈ AllowedScopes(LEX.TokenClass)` (see § 7.5).\n\n#### E.10:8.8 - Autonomy lexicon (L‑AUTO )\n**Forbidden (Core):** bare “validity”, “actor/agent” (as free‑standing nouns), “kill switch”, “process” for behavior, “envelope” when used **as scope**.\n**Use instead:** *Scope (G)* for epistemic scope; *WorkScope* for capability bounds; *RoleAssignment* for who acts; *SpeechAct* for overrides; *SafeStop* instead of “kill switch”.\n**Named prefixes (policy & registry):**\n* `aut:` for AutonomyBudgetDecl fields (e.g., `aut:action_tokens`, `aut:risk_bands`);\n* `guard:` for guard checks bound to `AdmissibilityConditionsId`;\n* `ovr:` for override SpeechActs (`ovr:PauseAutonomy`, `ovr:ResumeAutonomy`, …).\n\n**Notes.**\n1) Scope‑sensitive guards **must** declare the **Γ_time** window selector used for admission checks.\n2) Proper names of patterns/components that already include “Agent/Agency” (e.g., *Agency‑CHR*, *Agent‑Tools‑CAL*) are permitted as **titled terms**; avoid re‑introducing “agent” as a free‑standing noun in new prose.\n\n#### E.10:8.9 - LEX-CHR-STRICT — Reserve *Characteristic* for CSLC-measurable aspects\n\n**Intent.** Prevent calling **non-measurable** objects (sets, statuses, scopes, policies, bridges, contexts, guards) “characteristics”.\n\n**Rule L-CHR-S1 (Reservation).** Use **Characteristic** **only** for variables that **declare a CSLC scale** (nominal/ordinal/interval/ratio) with admissible values/units/polarity (Part C.16/A.17–A.18).  \n**Rule L-CHR-S2 (USM).** `U.Scope` / `U.ClaimScope (G)` / `U.WorkScope` are **USM scope objects**, not Characteristics; they **must not** appear in any `CharacteristicSpace`.  \n**Rule L-CHR-S3 (Status).** ESG/RSG statuses and deontic/epistemic statuses — **not Characteristics**; its statuses/states.  \n**Rule L-CHR-S4 (Lexical classifiers).** Lexical classifiers/tags — **Facets**/**attributes**; do not name them as Characteristics, if not declared **CSLC**.\n**Checks.**  \n— **CC-L-CHR-1.** `scope characteristic(s)` is banned in Core/Context.  \n— **CC-L-CHR-2.** `CharacteristicSpace` near `Scope` — error.  \n— **CC-L-CHR-3.** Canonical rewrite: `F–G–R characteristics` → `F–G–R components`.\n\n#### E.10:8.10 - LEX‑QA‑1 — Using “‑ility/‑ilities” terms (availability, reliability, …)\n\n**Rule.** Tokens ending with **‑ility/‑ilities** or widely used quality names (**Availability, Reliability, Security, Safety, Scalability, Maintainability, Usability**, …) are **Quality‑Family labels**, not automatically CHR **Characteristics**.  \n\n**Authoring choice:**  \n— To use such a term as a **CHR** characteristic (axis), **bind** it to a **named `U.Characteristic` with one CSLC Scale** (A.18) and refer to that Characteristic in guards/UTS;  \n— Otherwise **publish a Q‑Bundle** (see **C.25**) that includes **Measures (CHR)** (the measurable slots) and, where relevant, **Scope** (USM set over `U.ContextSlice`) and windows/mechanism/status fields.  \n\n**Rationale.** Scope is **set‑valued** (USM) and **not** a CHR measurement; mechanisms/statuses are governance artefacts. Keeping them outside the CHR CSLC avoids illegal scalarisation and preserves set‑algebra semantics for scope.  (A.2.6 § 6.2; A.6.1; C.16/A.18). \n\n",

        "solution": "### E.12:4 - **Solution**\n\nFPF elevates **Didactic Primacy (Pillar P-2)** to a normative architectural principle, operationalized through two conceptual mechanisms designed to act as a permanent counterbalance to excessive formalism.\n\n#### E.12:4.1 - The Principle of Didactic Primacy (Expanded Definition)\n\nThe primary purpose of the FPF is to enhance the cognitive capabilities (`U.Capability`/`Mastery`) of an Agent (`U.Agent`) in service of its Objectives (`U.Objective`). The creation of artifacts with high assurance levels and epistemic scores is a *means to that end, not the end itself*. Any architectural decision that increases formal rigor at the cost of clarity or usability must be explicitly justified by a demonstrable gain in the agent's ability to reason effectively.\n\n#### E.12:4.2 - Mechanism 1: The Rationale Mandate\n\nEvery key assurance artifact (such as a `U.AssuranceCase` or `Proof`) **MUST** contain a mandatory, human-readable **`rationale`** component.\n\n*   **Nature:** The `rationale` is not a technical description but a narrative explanation.\n*   **Content:** It **MUST** answer the question: *\"How does achieving this level of formal assurance tangibly help the agent better understand the problem or make a more reliable decision?\"*\n*   **Purpose:** This mandate forces a moment of reflection, formally linking the act of formalization back to its pragmatic, cognitive purpose. An empty or perfunctory rationale indicates that the assurance work may be an exercise in formalism for its own sake.\n\n> **Didactic Note for Managers: The \"So What?\" Test**\n>\n> The Rationale Mandate is FPF's built-in \"So What?\" test. When your team presents a complex, formally verified artifact (`AssuranceLevel:L2`), the `rationale` is where they answer your fundamental question: \"This is impressive, but *so what*? How does this help us ship a better product, make a smarter investment, or avoid a critical risk?\" If the answer isn't clear and compelling in the `rationale`, the formal work may have been a waste of resources. It keeps your most brilliant minds focused on creating value, not just elegant proofs.\n\n#### E.12:4.3 - Mechanism 2: The Human-Factor Loop (HF-Loop)**\n\nTo provide a continuous, self-correcting mechanism against cognitive overload, FPF introduces a conceptual feedback loop.\n\n*   **Core Concept:** The HF-Loop is a formal method of inquiry designed to distinguish between the *essential complexity* of the problem being solved and the *incidental complexity* introduced by the FPF itself.\n*   **Trigger Concept:** A review is triggered when the **subjective cognitive workload** associated with using the framework exceeds a conceptual threshold. This is not about performance metrics, but about the perceived mental effort required to use FPF's concepts and structures.\n*   **Review Concept:** When triggered, a formal review is conducted by individuals in roles that specialize in human-centric perspectives, such as the **`Ethicist`** and **`UX Design Critic`**.\n*   **Output Concept:** The review produces a set of proposed **conceptual simplifications** or **didactic improvements** to the framework's patterns or architheories. These are then submitted as formal change proposals (DRRs).\n\n#### E.12:5 - **Conformance Checklist**\n\n*   **CC-E12.1 (Rationale Mandate):** Every `U.AssuranceCase` or `Proof` artifact at `AssuranceLevel:L2` **MUST** contain a non-empty `rationale` component that satisfies the \"So What?\" test.\n*   **CC-E12.2 (HF-Loop Trigger Condition):** Each architheory that defines a significant workflow **SHOULD** specify a conceptual condition for triggering an HF-Loop review, based on the principle of managing cognitive load.\n*   **CC-E12.3 (HF-Loop Review Mandate):** If a trigger condition is met, a review involving the designated human-centric roles **MUST** be initiated. Its outcome **MUST** be a documented set of conceptual refinement proposals.\n*   **CC-E12.4 (Didactic Primacy in DRRs):** Any DRR proposing a change to a normative pattern **MUST** include a section analyzing its impact on cognitive ergonomics and didactic clarity.\n\n#### E.12:6 - **Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them**\n\n| Anti-Pattern | Manager's View: What It Looks Like | How FPF Prevents It (Conceptually) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **The \"Ivory Tower\" Framework** | The FPF specification becomes a beautiful but impenetrable fortress of abstract logic that no practicing engineer can actually use. | The **HF-Loop** provides a formal channel for user feedback to drive conceptual simplification. The roles of `UX Design Critic` and `Ethicist` are constitutionally empowered to challenge complexity that does not serve a clear purpose. |\n| **The \"Meaningless Rationale\"** | The `rationale` field is filled with boilerplate text like \"To increase assurance,\" without any real connection to the problem. | The \"So What?\" test is part of the review process for L2 artifacts. A perfunctory `rationale` is grounds for rejecting the artifact's promotion to L2, forcing the author to articulate the *real* value of their formal work. |\n| **Glorifying Complexity** | A culture emerges where the most complex and difficult-to-understand models are considered the \"best,\" regardless of their utility. | The core principle of **Cognitive Elegance (P-1)** and the mechanisms in this pattern create a constant pressure towards simplicity and clarity. The framework formally values understanding over mere complexity. |\n\n#### E.12:7 - **Consequences**\n\n| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Guards FPF's Core Mission:** This pattern acts as an \"immune system,\" protecting the framework from devolving into sterile formalism and ensuring it remains a tool for enhancing thought. | **Introduces \"Softer\" Concepts:** Cognitive load and rationale quality are less quantifiable than formal proofs. *Mitigation:* FPF operationalizes them through a formal method. The HF-Loop is a structured inquiry, not an informal chat. |\n| **Empowers Human-Centric Roles:** It gives the `Ethicist` and `UX Design Critic` roles a concrete, constitutional function in the evolution of the framework. | - |\n| **Prevents User Burnout and Rejection:** The HF-Loop is an early warning system that detects when the framework is becoming too cumbersome, allowing for course correction before users become frustrated and abandon it. | - |\n| **Creates a Self-Simplifying System:** The pattern creates a formal pressure that forces FPF to evolve towards greater clarity and usability, balancing the drive for formal rigor. | - |\n\n#### E.12:8 - **Rationale**\n\nThis pattern operationalizes **Didactic Primacy (P-2)**, transforming it from a philosophical statement into an enforceable architectural Standard. The `Rationale Mandate` ensures that every act of formalization is tied to a clear purpose. The `Human-Factor Loop` ensures that the *cost* of using the framework is measured not just in resources, but in the most critical resource of all: the cognitive capacity of its users.\n\nThis pattern does not weaken the formal rigor established by other ADRs; it complements it. It guarantees that the powerful machinery of FPF is always directed towards a meaningful, human-relevant goal. It is the constitutional guarantee that FPF will remain, first and foremost, an \"Operating System for Thought.\"\n\n#### E.12:9 - **Relations**\n\n*   **Implements:** Pillar `P-2 Didactic Primacy`.\n*   **Complements:** `E.13 Pragmatic Utility & Value Alignment` (which focuses on the relevance of the *problem*, while this pattern focuses on the usability of the *framework*).\n*   **Is constrained by:** The overall governance process (DRRs), which is the vehicle for implementing the conceptual simplifications proposed by the HF-Loop.\n",

The framework is used to build beautiful solutions to the wrong problems.\n2.  **Proxy-Metric Distortion (Goodhart's Law):** Teams successfully optimize for a chosen proxy characteristic, but in doing so, they diverge from—or even actively undermine—the true, often qualitative, `U.Objective` that the proxy was intended to represent.

        "solution": "### E.13:4 - **Solution**\n\nFPF elevates **Pragmatic Utility (Pillar P-7)** to a normative architectural principle, operationalized through two mandatory conceptual mechanisms.\n\n#### E.13:4.1 - The Principle of Pragmatic Utility (Expanded Definition)\n\nAny artifact created within the FPF is an instrument for achieving a specific, pragmatic `U.Objective`. The value of an artifact is determined solely by its **utility** in achieving that objective, not by its epistemic scores in isolation.\n\n#### E.13:4.2 - Mechanism 1: The Proxy-Audit Loop\n\nTo formally manage the risk of Goodhart's Law, FPF introduces a conceptual feedback loop to periodically review the alignment between proxy characteristics and their intended goals.\n\n*   **New Normative Relation:** A new relation, `isProxyFor: U.Characteristic → U.Objective`, is introduced. This relation **MUST** be used to explicitly declare when a measurable characteristic is serving as a proxy for a higher-level, often qualitative, goal.\n*   **Conceptual Audit Process:** Any characteristic marked with the `isProxyFor` relation is subject to a **periodic conceptual audit**.\n*   **Review Roles:** This audit is conceptually performed by the individual(s) in the **`Strategist`** role. They are tasked with answering the question: *\"Is optimizing for this proxy still reliably driving progress toward the actual `U.Objective` it represents, or have we observed a divergence?\"*\n*   **Output Concept:** If a divergence is identified, a high-priority `U.Method` for revising or replacing the proxy **MUST** be proposed.\n\n> **Didactic Note for Managers: Are You Climbing the Right Mountain?**\n>\n> The Proxy-Audit Loop is your compass. Your team's dashboards might show all green—metrics are improving, targets are being hit. But the audit loop forces a crucial question: \"Are these the *right* metrics?\"\n>\n> Imagine you are trying to improve \"customer satisfaction\" (`U.Objective`). You choose \"average call handle time\" as a proxy metric. Your team successfully drives this number down. But the Proxy-Audit reveals that customer satisfaction is actually *decreasing* because agents are rushing and providing poor service to meet the time target. The loop forces you to recognize this divergence and find a better proxy (e.g., \"first-call resolution rate\"). It ensures your team is not just climbing fast, but climbing the right mountain.\n\n#### E.13:4.3 - Mechanism 2: The Minimally Viable Example (MVE) Mandate\n\nTo enforce a pragmatic, value-first approach from the very beginning of a project, any new `U.System` or major system component **MUST** begin its development cycle with the creation of a **Minimally Viable Example (MVE)**.\n\n*   **Definition:** An MVE is a simple, end-to-end, working instance of the holon that demonstrates the achievement of at least one core, user-facing objective, however trivial. It is the FPF equivalent of a \"Hello, World\" for a complex system.\n*   **Assurance Requirement:** The MVE **MUST** achieve a minimum of **`AssuranceLevel:L1 (Substantiated)`**. This means the MVE cannot be a mere mock-up or a purely conceptual sketch; it must be supported by at least one piece of tangible evidence (e.g., a passing test case, a formal assertion), as defined in Pattern B.3.3.\n*   **Stege transition Precedence:** The development of the full-scale holon cannot proceed to `AssuranceLevel:L2` until the MVE has been created and has met its L1 requirement.\n",

The outcome of this review **MUST** be a documented episteme.\n*   **CC-E13.3 (MVE Mandate):** The development of any new `U.System` **MUST** be preceded by the creation of an MVE that satisfies the `AssuranceLevel:L1` requirement.\n*   **CC-E13.4 (MVE Traceability):** The full-scale `U.System` **MUST** maintain a formal traceability link (`isEvolutionOf`) to its originating MVE.\n",

Because the whole is conceptually *constructed* from those parts, the team may safely speak of each part as *Component Of* the skid. The justification is the construction itself: if any listed part were removed, the very same skid would no longer exist as that whole. This keeps identity extensional and makes the engineer‑facing alias (“Component Of”) truthful rather than conventional.\n\n2. **Parallel elements gathered → “Member Of”**\n   A test rig has four identical cartridges used in parallel. The rig treats them as a conceptual *gathering*; membership is fixed by inclusion in that gathering, not by sequence or timing. Speaking of each cartridge as *Member Of* the rig’s cartridge bank is then licensed by the same gathering act. Engineers can keep saying “member,” while architects know the warrant is the underlying construction of the bank as a collection, not an accidental tagging.\n\n3. **Focused facet carved → “Aspect Of”**\n   When the team talks about the *thermal envelope* of a reactor, they are not multiplying entities; they are taking the already‑agreed reactor and conceptually *carving out* its thermal facet for focused reasoning. Calling that carve‑out an *Aspect Of* the reactor is justified because the aspect owes its identity to the parent and the chosen facet, and nothing else. This licenses disciplined talk about “boundary,” “interface,” or “envelope” without mistaking them for independent systems.\n\n> **Notes across the examples**\n> • Everyday aliases (*Component Of, Member Of, Aspect Of*) remain the only labels engineers need to see; their truth is anchored by prior constructional choices.  \n> • Structural links draw on **Constructive** grounding; **epistemic links**—like “Representation Of” or “Usage Of”—may instead rely on **Empirical Validation** (evidence bundles) or **Logical** grounding appropriate to the claim.  \n\n**F — Resulting Context (after you apply the pattern)**\n\n**What improves**\n\n* **Single dial for containment.** Teams can ask one plain question—“what is inside what?”—and trust that all structural talk reduces to shared constructional choices rather than ad‑hoc relation lists. Ontologists keep rigorous warrants without burdening day‑to‑day readers.\n* **Extensional identity by default.** Wholes are the wholes they are because of the parts gathered; collections are the collections they are because of their members; aspects inherit identity from their parent and facet. This prevents silent drift when labels change.\n* **Layer harmony.** Engineer‑facing aliases live at the same level as other relation names, while their warrants live one step below, keeping human language clean and the generative basis auditable.\n\n**What to watch**\n\n* **Discipline at the structural tier.** A structural link that lacks a constructional warrant is conceptually unsafe. Conversely, forcing epistemic links to pretend they are structural over‑physicalises knowledge claims; for those, evidence or argument is the right currency.\n* **Author workload moves, not grows.** Day‑to‑day model authors stay with aliases; specification authors carry the burden of ensuring every structural statement really follows from a sum, a gathering, or a carve‑out. This is a conscious shift of complexity away from operations and into the pattern’s foundation.\n\n**Invariants you must preserve**\n\n* **Parsimony of constructors.** Build wholes by summing parts; build banks by gathering elements; focus facets by carving aspects. Do not invent extra generative acts for parallelism or time‑slicing; those concerns belong to other conceptual services.\n* **Two‑tier justification.** Structural talk rides on construction; epistemic talk rides on evidence or proof. Keep the boundary sharp so that later reasoning (about reliability, compliance, or policy) remains clear.\n\n**Known consequences**\n\n* **Stable queries, fewer surprises.** Because aliases are backed by shared constructions, teams from different disciplines can interoperate without renegotiating meanings at hand‑off.\n* **Audit trail without jargon.** Reviewers can trace every structural claim to a prior constructional choice, while everyday collaborators keep using familiar relation names.\n\n",

The canonical template and style principles institutionalise this choice without inviting notation lock‑in.\n\n**Why grounding flows downward.** Mapping, Logical, Constructive, and Empirical supports are **assurance shoulders** that sit *beneath* the Working‑Model claim. Authors select the shoulder(s) that fit purpose and risk: type/lexical alignment (**TA**), reasoned consequence (**VA**), constructive reconstruction (**VA**), and real‑world confirmation (**LA**). This keeps the Kernel small, avoids plane‑mixing, and provides a clear path to stronger guarantees when warranted.\n\n**Why patterns teach before they tighten.** The Tell‑Show‑Show requirement couples each universal rule with System/Episteme illustrations, reducing cognitive load and preventing premature formalism. It is the didactic mechanism that makes Human‑Centric Canonization practical across disciplines.\n\n**Why no notation talk in Core.** Guard‑rails and the style guide prohibit tool jargon and notation dependence inside normative prose; meanings are given in words and mathematics, with any renderings treated as illustrative only.

Vendor/tool tokens are kept as *informative*, not normative.\n\n1. **Corrigibility & safe interruptibility (2016→).**  \n   **Adopt/Adapt.** Work on safe interruption and “off‑switch” incentives argues that capable systems should remain *stoppable* and should not be rewarded for resisting oversight (Orseau & Armstrong, 2016; Hadfield‑Menell et al., 2017). E.16 adapts this into canonical **PauseAutonomy / ResumeAutonomy** SpeechActs plus **SoD** and *hard* gating on depletion.\n\n2. **AI safety as concrete operational hazards (2016→).**  \n   **Adopt.** “Concrete Problems in AI Safety” pushes instrumentation and testable safety constraints over informal assurances (Amodei et al., 2016). E.16 mirrors this by turning “autonomy” into a **budget + ledger + guards** contract that can be benchmarked and audited.\n\n3. **SRE error budgets & “stop the line” operations (2016→).**  \n   **Adopt/Adapt.** Error‑budget practice treats reliability as a measurable envelope that gates risky change when depleted (Beyer et al., *Site Reliability Engineering*, 2016; Höller et al., *The Site Reliability Workbook*, 2018). E.16 adapts the idea into `risk_bands` and depletion behavior that blocks autonomy‑gated steps until governed resume.\n\n4. **Risk management frameworks for AI systems (2023→).**  \n   **Adopt/Adapt.** Contemporary risk frameworks emphasize governance, continuous measurement, and traceable controls (NIST AI RMF 1.0, 2023; ISO/IEC 23894, 2023). E.16 adapts these into **UTS publication** + **Work‑anchored ledger evidence** for parity and audit.\n\n5. **Policy‑as‑code and provenance gating (2019→).**  \n   **Adopt.** Modern supply‑chain integrity systems emphasize *policy‑checked actions with verifiable provenance* (in‑toto, 2019→; SLSA, 2021→). E.16 echoes the same principle for autonomy: **no autonomy‑gated enactment without passing declared guards and emitting ledger evidence** (without importing any specific tooling).\n\n6. **Scaling laws & the Bitter Lesson (2019→).**  \n   **Adapt/Reject.** Empirical scaling work and the Bitter Lesson motivate considering compute‑heavy search when returns are monotonic (Sutton, 2019; Kaplan et al., 2020). E.16 adapts this into an **optional** ScaleLensPolicy (E.16‑S7) constrained by the *same* budgets and guards, and **rejects** any interpretation that lets “scale” bypass safety gates.\n",

        "problem": "### E.17.0:2 - Problem  *(informative, but sharp)*\n\nWithout `U.MultiViewDescribing`:\n\n1. **Viewpoints, views, and surfaces collapse.**\n   In practice, “architecture view”, “diagram”, “spec”, and “published deck” are used interchangeably. This:\n\n   * confuses *episteme* (`U.View`) with *carrier* (`U.Surface`),\n   * hides which **concerns and stakeholders** a description is written for,\n   * makes it impossible to check whether a given description family is “complete enough” for a chosen viewpoint library.\n\n2. **Descriptions float without viewpoints.**\n   Legacy I/D/S discipline distinguishes Intension vs Description vs Spec, but does not, on its own, forbid “view‑from‑nowhere” descriptions (no declared viewpoint). That contradicts the pragmatic stance encoded in C.2.1: **no episteme without concerns**.\n\n3. **Each domain reinvents multi‑view semantics.**\n   Architecture, safety cases, governance frameworks, and research workflows all use local notions of “view”, “viewpoint”, and “consistency between views”. Without a shared pattern:\n\n   * E.TGA, MVPK, and discipline packs introduce their own “view” laws, duplicating work;\n   * cross‑domain reasoning (e.g. mapping a safety view to an architecture view) becomes ad‑hoc;\n   * we cannot give a single formal story for consistency, correspondence, and EpistemicViewing across families of descriptions.\n\n4. **No place to attach correspondence.**\n   ISO 42010‑style *correspondences* and modern BX/consistency relations have nowhere canonical to live. We need a **CorrespondenceModel over families of D/S epistemes** that integrates with `U.EpistemicViewing`/`U.EpistemicRetargeting` and C.2.1’s slot graph.\n",

        "solution": "### E.17.0:4 - Solution — `U.MultiViewDescribing` as the universal multi‑view scaffold  *(normative core)*\n\n#### E.17.0:4.1 - Overview\n\n`U.MultiViewDescribing` organises **families of descriptions/specifications** for a shared entity‑of‑interest into a multi‑view structure with:\n\n* **explicit viewpoints** (`U.Viewpoint`) as intensional specs of stakeholders, concerns, allowed D/S kinds, and conformance rules; \n* **episteme‑level views** (`U.View = U.EpistemeView`) as view‑epistemes over those descriptions/specs; \n* a **CorrespondenceModel** capturing correspondences between D/S and their views across viewpoints.\n\nThe pattern is **parameterised by a class of described entities**:\n\n> **Parameter:** `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity` — the class of entities‑of‑interest\n> (typical species: `U.Holon` for engineering holons, `U.Morphism` for morphism publication, `U.Episteme` for meta‑describing epistemes).\n\nAll members of a `U.MultiViewDescribing[EoIClass]` family share:\n\n* `DescribedEntitySlot` value in that `EoIClass`, and\n* a `BoundedContextRef` (E.10.D1) forming a **DescriptionScope** together with the entity. \n\nInformally:\n\n* Fix an entity `T ∈ EoIClass` and a bounded context `C`.\n* The **multi‑view family** for `<T,C>` consists of a set of `…Description` / `…Spec` epistemes, each under a declared viewpoint, plus their `U.View` views, together with a correspondence model relating them.\n\n#### E.17.0:4.2 - Core constructs\n\n##### E.17.0:4.2.1 - `EoIClass` and DescriptionScope\n\n1. **EoIClass.**\n   A `U.MultiViewDescribing` instance declares an `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity` that acts as a **species‑level constraint** on the ValueKind of `DescribedEntitySlot`.\n\n   * In engineering species (TEVB) this is typically `U.Holon` restricted to `U.System` or `U.Episteme`. \n   * In MVPK, `EoIClass = U.Morphism`. \n\n2. **DescriptionScope (informal).**\n   For a fixed `T ∈ EoIClass` and `C : U.BoundedContext`, the **DescriptionScope** `Scope(T,C)` is the notional scope under which:\n\n   * all descriptions/specifications have `DescribedEntityRef = T` and `BoundedContextRef = C` in their DescriptionContext; \n   * all views (`U.View`) attached to this family preserve that `DescribedEntityRef` and `BoundedContextRef` (for D/S views).\n\n   Formal USM treatment of `U.DescriptionScope` is fixed in E.10/L‑SURF; here we only rely on the intuition “**we are describing this thing, in this context**”.\n\n##### E.17.0:4.2.2 - `U.Viewpoint` (intensional viewpoint spec)\n\n`U.Viewpoint` is already introduced in C.2.1 as the ValueKind of `ViewpointSlot`; E.17.0 fixes its **internal structure** for describing families. \n\n**Definition (normative, intensional).**\nA `U.Viewpoint` is an intensional specification:\n\n* `EoIClassSpec ⊑ U.Entity` — the class of entities this viewpoint is defined for (must be compatible with the family’s `EoIClass`);\n* `StakeholderFamilies : FinSet(U.RoleEnactor)` — stakeholder / RoleEnactor families the viewpoint speaks for (e.g. “safety engineers”, “operations teams”).\n* `Concerns : FinSet(U.Concern)` — concern set (qualities, risks, obligations) that matter under this viewpoint.\n* `AllowedEpistemeKinds : FinSet(U.EpistemeKindId)` — which D/S episteme kinds are admissible as **primary descriptions** and as **derived views** under this viewpoint (e.g. system‑level behaviour description, test harness spec, safety case, CG‑Spec slice).\n* `ConformanceRules` — a structured bundle of rules/tests describing when a D/S episteme or view **conforms** to the viewpoint, including:\n\n  * minimal content requirements (e.g. “must cover all safety‑critical functions”),\n  * admissible `U.EpistemicViewing` pipelines to derive views from base descriptions,\n  * allowed degrees of incompleteness and evidence requirements (link to GateProfiles/`OperationalGate(profile)` checks and Part F harnesses).\n\n**Slot alignment.**\n\n* `ViewpointSlot` has ValueKind `U.Viewpoint`, RefKind `U.ViewpointRef`; episteme fields are named `viewpointRef : U.ViewpointRef?`. \n* For D/S epistemes in a `U.MultiViewDescribing` family, `viewpointRef` is **mandatory** as part of `DescriptionContext`.\n\n##### E.17.0:4.2.3 - `U.View` (episteme‑level views)\n\n`U.View` is an alias for `U.EpistemeView`, a species of `U.Episteme` whose kind includes:\n\n* `ClaimGraphSlot` (often a sliced or projected ClaimGraph),\n* `DescribedEntitySlot`,\n* `ViewpointSlot`,\n* `ReferenceSchemeSlot` (and usually a `RepresentationSchemeSlot` in C.2.1+).\n\nNormatively:\n\n* A `U.View` in `U.MultiViewDescribing` is obtained via a `U.EpistemicViewing` morphism from some base D/S episteme in the family (see 4.3). It **shares the same `describedEntityRef`** and usually the same `BoundedContextRef`.\n* `ViewSlot` is reserved for **references to such views** in meta‑structures (e.g. correspondence models, MVPK view families), never for carriers.\n\n##### E.17.0:4.2.4 - `U.CorrespondenceModel` (view–view correspondence)\n\n`U.CorrespondenceModel` is an episteme (typically a `U.EpistemeCard`) whose ClaimGraph expresses **correspondence relations between D/S epistemes and/or views** within a DescriptionScope:\n\n* cross‑viewpoint correspondences (e.g. “this safety requirement is realised by this design element”),\n* structural/behavioural consistency conditions (BX‑style consistency relations),\n* change‑impact links (which views must be revisited when some view changes).\n\n`CorrespondenceModel` is **used, but not defined, by A.6.3**: species of `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing` reference it when computing views that depend on multiple epistemes or representation regimes.\n\n#### E.17.0:4.3 - Multi‑view families and their laws (MVD‑0…MVD‑7)  *(normative)*\n\nWe now fix the laws that any `U.MultiViewDescribing[EoIClass]` instance must satisfy.\n\n##### E.17.0:4.3.0 - MVD‑0 - Family objects\n\nFor a fixed `EoIClass` and bounded context `C`, a **multi‑view family** for an entity `T ∈ EoIClass` consists of:\n\n* a (finite) set `D_S(T,C)` of D/S epistemes such that for each `E ∈ D_S(T,C)`:\n\n  * `E : U.Episteme` of some kind in `AllowedEpistemeKinds` of its viewpoint,\n  * `subjectRef(E)` decodes to `DescriptionContext(E) = ⟨DescribedEntityRef = T, BoundedContextRef = C, ViewpointRef(E)⟩`,\n  * `viewpointRef(E)` lies in the family’s viewpoint set `Σ ⊆ FinSet(U.Viewpoint)`;\n* a set `Views(T,C) ⊆ U.View` of view‑epistemes over those D/S epistemes, obtained by declared `U.EpistemicViewing` species (see MVD‑3);\n* zero or more `U.CorrespondenceModel` epistemes over `{D_S(T,C), Views(T,C)}`.\n\nFamilies are **scoped**: the same entity in a different `U.BoundedContext` belongs to a different family.\n\n##### E.17.0:4.3.1 - MVD‑1 - Viewpoint locality and totality for D/S\n\nFor any multi‑view family:\n\n1. **Viewpoint‑totality for D/S.**\n   Each D/S episteme in `D_S(T,C)` **MUST** have a `viewpointRef` either:\n\n   * explicitly populated, or\n   * deterministically derived from a `U.ViewpointBundle` the family declares (see E.17.1).\n\n   There are no “viewpoint‑free” D/S epistemes inside a `U.MultiViewDescribing` family.\n\n2. **Viewpoint locality.**\n   `ViewpointRef` values for `D_S(T,C)` must belong to a **finite viewpoint set `Σ`** declared for the family (locally or via a bundle). Cross‑family reuse happens **via bundles and Bridges**, not by silently sharing viewpoints across unrelated scopes.\n\n3. **DescriptionContext alignment.**\n   `DescriptionContext(E)` for any D/S episteme in the family must use the **same `DescribedEntityRef` and `BoundedContextRef`** as the family; any change of described entity or context is **outside this family** and must be expressed via `U.EpistemicRetargeting` and/or Context Bridges.\n\n#### E.17.0:4.3.2 - MVD‑2 - Views are EpistemicViewing results\n\nFor any `V ∈ Views(T,C)`:\n\n1. There exists a base episteme `E ∈ D_S(T,C)` and a morphism `v : E → V` such that:\n\n   * `v` is a species of `U.EpistemicViewing`, i.e. an **effect‑free, describedEntity‑preserving** episteme morphism;\n   * `describedEntityRef(V) = describedEntityRef(E) = T`,\n   * `BoundedContextRef(V) = BoundedContextRef(E) = C`,\n   * `viewpointRef(V)` is either:\n\n     * the same as `viewpointRef(E)` (internal normalisation), or\n     * a viewpoint in the same family `Σ`, with the change recorded in the family’s `CorrespondenceModel` (see MVD‑4).\n\n2. No view may be introduced “out of thin air”: every `U.View` in the family is traceable to at least one D/S episteme (or a finite diagram thereof) via a **documented EpistemicViewing pipeline**.\n\n3. Views **do not introduce new intensional commitments** about `T` beyond what is licensed by EFEM & EpistemicViewing laws (no new atomic claims about the same described entity). Strengthening Intension requires new D/S under A.7/E.10.D2, not a view.\n\n#### E.17.0:4.3.3 - MVD‑3 - Applicability profiles for viewings\n\nAny EpistemicViewing species used inside `U.MultiViewDescribing` **MUST**:\n\n* declare an Applicability profile as per EV‑6: permitted `EoIClass`, grounding, viewpoint ranges, and representation schemes; \n* for D/S epistemes in a family:\n\n  * **preserve** `DescribedEntityRef` and `BoundedContextRef` of `DescriptionContext`,\n  * either preserve `ViewpointRef` or change it **within the family’s viewpoint bundle**, with constraints recorded in `CorrespondenceModel`,\n  * never widen ClaimScope beyond EFEM/EpistemicViewing allowances.\n\nAny change of described entity (even “small”, e.g. subsystem→system) must be expressed via `U.EpistemicRetargeting` and is **not** a MultiViewDescribing view refinement.\n\n#### E.17.0:4.3.4 - MVD‑4 - CorrespondenceModel as the home of cross‑view correspondences\n\nWhen views or D/S epistemes under different viewpoints are meant to be **kept in correspondence** (in ISO 42010 or BX sense), the family **SHALL**:\n\n1. Provide a `U.CorrespondenceModel` episteme whose `ClaimGraph` captures correspondences and consistency relations over `{D_S(T,C), Views(T,C)}`.\n\n2. Ensure that any `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing` that depends on multiple epistemes or representation schemes:\n\n   * references that `CorrespondenceModel`, and\n   * publishes witnesses (proof objects, trace links) that make diagrams commute up to declared isomorphism (oplax naturality allowed).\n\n3. Treat temporary inconsistency explicitly: there may be states where some correspondences are violated; this is represented as **facts in the correspondence ClaimGraph**, not as hidden weakening of viewing laws.\n\n#### E.17.0:4.3.5 - MVD‑5 - Separation from publication (MVPK)\n\n`U.MultiViewDescribing` is purely **epistemic**:\n\n* D/S epistemes and views live entirely in Ep‑space (`U.Episteme`);\n* it does **not** define PublicationSurface, carriers or rendering;\n* MVPK (E.17) sits **on top**:\n\n  * taking morphisms and/or D/S epistemes as input,\n  * using `U.EpistemicViewing` plus publication‑specific viewpoints,\n  * emitting `U.View` instances that then get attached to Surfaces via L‑SURF.\n\nMultiViewDescribing therefore **does not re‑define I→D/D→S** (`Describe_ID`, `Specify_DS`) and does not introduce any Work on carriers; those remain in A.7/E.10.D2 and E.17.\n\n#### E.17.0:4.3.6 - MVD‑6 - I/D/S alignment\n\nFor any `U.MultiViewDescribing` instance:\n\n1. Every `…Description` and `…Spec` episteme in the family must satisfy E.10.D2:\n\n   * be an episteme with `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`,\n   * be linked to a unique Intension via `isDescriptionOf` / `isSpecOf` with the additional `ViewpointRef` parameter.\n\n2. Viewings and correspondence operations **must not**:\n\n   * collapse Intension into episteme,\n   * confuse D/S with publication surfaces,\n   * reinterpret described entity without going through A.6.4 retargeting.\n\n#### E.17.0:4.3.7 - MVD‑7 - Slot discipline\n\nAll constructs in this pattern **SHALL** respect `U.RelationSlotDiscipline`:\n\n* SlotKinds (`DescribedEntitySlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot`, `GroundingHolonSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot`) and their ValueKinds/RefKinds follow A.6.5 and C.2.1.\n* `*Slot` suffix is reserved for SlotKinds; `*Ref` for RefKinds/fields, never for Kinds or objects. \n* MultiViewDescribing patterns **must not** invent parallel slot disciplines for “roles in relations”; they reuse SlotKind as the notion of position.\n",
        "archetypal_grounding": "### E.17.0:5 - Archetypal grounding  *(informative)*\n\n1. **Engineering holon (TEVB).** \n   * `EoIClass = U.Holon` (restricted to `U.System`/`U.Episteme`).\n   * TEVB (E.17.2) supplies a viewpoint bundle with canonical engineering viewpoints: Functional, Structural, Role‑Enactor, Module‑Interface, etc.\n   * For a particular system `S` in context `C`, D/S epistemes include functional descriptions, structural designs, role‑enactment models, and interface specs.\n   * Views derived via EpistemicViewing include sliced safety views, performance‑focused views, and minimal runbooks.\n   * `CorrespondenceModel` records how functional elements are realised structurally, where hazards map to components, etc.\n\n2. **Morphism publication (MVPK).**\n   * `EoIClass = U.Morphism`.\n   * D/S epistemes capture the semantic characterisation of morphisms (pre‑/post‑conditions, CG‑Specs, CHR pins).\n   * Viewpoints are publication‑oriented (`PlainView`, `TechCard`, `InteropCard`, `AssuranceLane`); views are MVPK faces over those morphisms.\n   * CorrespondenceModel states how the same morphism appears as a simple narrative, a typed card with units, an interoperability card, and an assurance lane with evidence bindings — all without new claims.\n\n3. **Safety case vs architecture vs operations.**\n   * `EoIClass = U.Holon`.\n   * Viewpoints: SafetyCase, Architecture, Operations.\n   * Families tie together safety requirements, architectural structures, and operational procedures for the same plant `P` in context `C`.\n   * Views: a safety‑focused slice of the architecture description, an operational runbook annotated with safety invariants, etc.\n   * CorrespondenceModel expresses coverage and consistency between these views, enabling BX‑style repair when one side changes.\n",
        "conformance_checklist": "### E.17.0:6 - Conformance checklist (author’s quick use)  *(normative)*\n\nWhen defining a new `U.MultiViewDescribing` species or using it in a discipline pack:\n\n1. **Declare the EoIClass.**\n   *Explicitly state `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity` and ensure all families restrict `DescribedEntitySlot` accordingly.*\n\n2. **Define the viewpoint set Σ.**\n   *List `U.Viewpoint` instances (possibly via a `U.ViewpointBundle`) with stakeholders, concerns, allowed EpistemeKinds, and conformance rules.*\n\n3. **Require DescriptionContext for D/S.**\n   *Ensure every `…Description`/`…Spec` episteme in the family has `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` and that `ViewpointRef ∈ Σ`.*\n\n4. **Specify admissible EpistemicViewing species.**\n   *List the `U.EpistemicViewing` profiles used to derive views; declare their Applicability profiles and assert they are describedEntity‑preserving (EV‑6).*\n\n5. **Attach CorrespondenceModel where needed.**\n   *Whenever cross‑view consistency matters, introduce a `U.CorrespondenceModel` episteme and reference it from any `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing`.*\n\n6. **Separate describing from publication.**\n   *Check that pattern text does not treat I→D/D→S as “publication”, and that any talk of Surfaces/carriers is clearly delegated to MVPK/L‑SURF.*\n\n7. **Respect SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline.**\n   *Use `*Slot` only for SlotKinds, `*Ref` only for RefKinds/fields; avoid `Subject`/`Object` roots in episteme types; use `DescribedEntitySlot` and `viewpointRef` instead.*\n",
        "consequences": "### E.17.0:7 - Consequences  *(informative)*\n\n* **Unified multi‑view story across domains.**\n  Engineering descriptions, safety cases, governance dossiers, research artefacts — all become instances of the same multi‑view pattern, enabling coherent tooling and education.\n\n* **Explicit, testable viewpoints.**\n  Viewpoints move from vague labels (“architecture view”) to first‑class objects (`U.Viewpoint`) with stakeholder families, concerns, allowed D/S kinds, and conformance rules. This allows `OperationalGate(profile)` checks and better review practices.\n\n* **Views as disciplined projections, not new documents.**\n  `U.View` is an episteme generated by viewings, not a free‑floating PowerPoint. This constrains what tools are allowed to do when “generating views”, and prevents silent strengthening of commitments.\n\n* **Correspondence as a first‑class citizen.**\n  Consistency and traceability between views are expressed via ClaimGraphs in `U.CorrespondenceModel`, not as scattered hyperlinks or spreadsheet columns.\n\n* **Clean separation of describing vs publishing.**\n  `U.MultiViewDescribing` ends the long‑standing conflation between describing (I→D→S) and publication (D/S→Surface). MVPK becomes a clean specialisation on top, not a second I/D/S discipline.\n\n* **Slot‑level interoperability.**\n  C.2.1/A.6.5 slot discipline applies uniformly; new domains can introduce viewpoint bundles and multi‑view families without inventing new ontologies for “view positions” or “roles in relations”.\n",
        "rationale": "### E.17.0:8 - Rationale & SoTA‑echoing  *(informative)*\n\n* **ISO 42010 and viewpoint libraries.**\n  ISO 42010 distinguished *viewpoints* (stakeholders + concerns + conventions) from *views* (descriptions under those viewpoints) and introduced viewpoint libraries. `U.MultiViewDescribing` generalises this beyond “architecture descriptions” to **any descriptions/specifications**, with `EoIClass` parameter and explicit viewpoint bundles used by TEVB and MVPK. \n\n* **MBSE & SysML v2 views‑as‑queries.**\n  Modern MBSE treats views as **queries over shared models** with controlled rendering. That aligns with `U.EpistemicViewing` as a pure, describedEntity‑preserving morphism, and with `U.View` as an episteme view derived from D/S under a viewpoint.\n\n* **BX / model synchronisation.**\n  Bidirectional transformations literature treats consistency relations and repair as first‑class. `U.CorrespondenceModel` and `U.CorrespondenceEpistemicViewing` provide an FPF‑native home for such relations, ensuring that consistency rules live in ClaimGraphs and respect episteme morphism laws, rather than being buried in tool code. \n\n* **Optics and displayed categories.**\n  With C.2.1 and A.6.3, epistemes form a category fibred over described entities; viewings act like optics over the episteme slot graph. `U.MultiViewDescribing` is the **displayed‑category‑like** organisation of families indexed by `DescribedEntitySlot` and `ViewpointSlot`, making later categorical reasoning (e.g. structured cospans for view composition) straightforward.\n\n* **Hybrid symbolic/latent representations.**\n  By treating `U.RepresentationScheme` and `U.RepresentationOperation` as episteme components, families can mix symbolic specs, diagrams, code, and latent representations (e.g. LLM‑based summaries) while staying within the same multi‑view discipline and EpistemicViewing laws.\n",
        "relations": "### E.17.0:9 - Relations  *(informative summary)*\n\n* **Builds on C.2.1 `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`.**\n  Uses `DescribedEntitySlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot`, `ClaimGraphSlot`, `ReferenceSchemeSlot` as the structural backbone for descriptions, views, and correspondence.\n\n* **Builds on A.6.2–A.6.4.**\n  Families rely on `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing` for view‑producing morphisms, `U.EpistemicViewing` for describedEntity‑preserving views, and `U.EpistemicRetargeting` for moves that change the described entity (outside a given family).\n\n* **Constrains E.17 (MVPK).**\n  MVPK is a **publication‑specialised MultiViewDescribing for morphisms**: its viewpoints are publication viewpoints; its ViewFamily is a special case of `Views(T,C)` with `T` a morphism; its laws must respect MVD‑0…MVD‑7.\n\n* **Constrains E.17.1 / E.17.2.**\n  `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` and TEVB provide concrete viewpoint bundles populating `Σ` for particular `EoIClass` (e.g. engineering holons), but they must treat viewpoints as `U.Viewpoint` values in `ViewpointSlot`, not as ad‑hoc tags. \n\n* **Coordinates with E.10.D2 (I/D/S) and E.10 LEX‑BUNDLE.**\n  Ensures every D/S episteme in a family has a DescriptionContext, keeps “Describe/Specify” distinct from “Publish”, and respects lexical guards around `View`, `Viewpoint`, `Surface`, `ViewFamilyId`, `*Slot`, `*Ref`.\n\n* **Coordinates with B.5.* / F‑cluster.**\n  Viewpoints’ stakeholder families and concerns link naturally with RoleEnactment (B.5.\\*) and Part F role descriptions, assignments, harnesses — without overloading `U.Role` as a coordinate in I/D/S or episteme slots.\n",

Normative architectural pattern.\n\n**Builds on:**\nA.6.2–A.6.4 (Episteme morphism classes),\nA.6.5 `U.RelationSlotDiscipline` (SlotKind/ValueKind/RefKind discipline),\nA.7 (Strict Distinction; I/D/S vs Surface),\nE.7 (Archetypal Grounding),\nE.10 (LEX‑BUNDLE, especially naming discipline for `ViewFamilyId`),\nE.10.D1/D2 (Context and I/D/S discipline),\nE.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing`.\n\n**Used by:**\nE.17.2 (TEVB — Typical Engineering Viewpoints Bundle),\nE.18:5.12 (E.TGA engineering viewpoint families),\nfuture domain‑specific viewpoint packs (architecture, governance, safety, research).\n\n**Guard (lexical & ontological).**\n\n* A **viewpoint bundle** is a family of `U.Viewpoint` values (intensional specs) plus metadata; it is **not** a collection of `U.View`, `PublicationSurface`, or files.\n* `ViewFamilyId` is a lexical tag that names a **viewpoint family** (bundle), never:\n  * a `U.View` kind,\n  * an MVPK face/surface kind,\n  * nor a file/folder label in L‑SURF.\n* `EngineeringVPId` / `PublicationVPId` remain separate (E.18:5.12, E.17); E.17.1 does **not** collapse engineering and publication viewpoints into one id.\n* Bundles are **intensional catalogue objects**: they specify reusable viewpoint families that `U.MultiViewDescribing` instances may import; they do not define new episteme kinds or surface kinds.\n",
        "problem": "### E.17.1:2 - Problem  *(informative)*\n\nWithout a dedicated pattern for viewpoint bundle libraries:\n\n1. **Each domain bakes its own “viewpoint sets”.**\n   E.TGA, MVPK, safety‑case disciplines, and governance packs tend to introduce local notions such as “engineering views”, “assurance views”, “governance decks” without a shared representation. Viewpoints drift, and cross‑domain mapping becomes opaque.\n\n2. **Viewpoint identity is unstable.**\n   A team may call something “functional view” in one project and “capability view” in another, even though the underlying concerns, stakeholders, and conformance rules are identical. The same `U.Viewpoint` is re‑invented and slightly renamed, making long‑term consistency and automation harder.\n\n3. **MultiViewDescribing cannot easily reuse families.**\n   `U.MultiViewDescribing` allows an arbitrary finite set of viewpoints Σ for each `<T,C>` (entity, context). Without a standard way to say “Σ is the TEVB engineering family” or “Σ is the governance‑risk bundle”, each family has to list viewpoints explicitly and locally.\n\n4. **ISO 42010 viewpoint libraries remain external.**\n   There is no canonical place in FPF where ISO‑style viewpoint libraries (for architecture descriptions) can be represented as first‑class objects and aligned with FPF’s `U.Viewpoint`, I/D/S discipline, and episteme morphisms.\n\n5. **Lexical aliases leak into semantics.**\n   Names like “Functional”, “SafetyCase”, or “Regulatory” may be used both as:\n\n   * intensional viewpoint specs; and\n   * ad‑hoc labels on documents, files or MVPK faces.\n     Without a clear lexical discipline, this causes confusion about what exactly is being reused.\n\nE.17.1 addresses these issues by introducing `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` as the place where **reusable viewpoint families** are defined, named, and versioned.\n",

        "solution": "### E.17.1:4 - Solution — `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary`  *(normative core)*\n\n#### E.17.1:4.1 - Overview\n\n`U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` is the **architectural home for reusable viewpoint families**.\n\n* A **viewpoint library** is a collection of **viewpoint bundles**; each bundle names and packages a finite family of `U.Viewpoint` values that are intended to be reused together.\n* Each **viewpoint bundle**:\n\n  * is identified by a `ViewFamilyId` lexical tag;\n  * constrains an `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity` for which its viewpoints are valid;\n  * enumerates a finite set Σ of `U.Viewpoint` definitions;\n  * may carry archetypal grounding cards (E.7) and alignment notes (e.g., ISO 42010 mappings).\n\n`U.MultiViewDescribing[EoIClass]` then uses such bundles as **providers of Σ** for families of descriptions/specifications:\n\n* for a fixed entity `T ∈ EoIClass` and bounded context `C`, a `U.MultiViewDescribing` family may declare:\n\n  * that its viewpoint set Σ is **imported from** a specific `ViewFamilyId`, possibly with a finite subset selection; or\n  * that Σ is locally defined (no bundle) — still allowed, but less reusable.\n\nTEVB (E.17.2) and E.TGA E.18:5.12 are species of this pattern for engineering holons.\n\n#### E.17.1:4.2 - Core constructs\n\n##### E.17.1:4.2.1 - `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` (library object)\n\n**Tech:** `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` (kernel/species type).\n**Plain:** viewpoint library.\n\nA `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` is a **catalogue of viewpoint bundles**, with at least:\n\n* `libraryId : LibraryId` — lexical identifier of the library (e.g. `FPF.Core.Viewpoints`, `OrgX.EngineeringViewpoints`).\n* `bundles : FinSet(U.ViewpointBundle)` — finite or countable set of bundles it provides.\n* `editionId : EditionId` — edition of the library, subject to the usual LEX‑AUTH / LAT discipline (E.15).\n* optional `scopeTags` and governance metadata (owner, change‑control).\n\n**Normative constraints.**\n\n1. Within a given `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` edition, `ViewFamilyId` values **SHALL be unique**.\n2. Libraries **SHALL NOT** define new kernel episteme kinds or surface kinds; they only package `U.Viewpoint` values and metadata.\n3. Libraries **MAY** be specialised:\n\n   * a core FPF library (e.g. TEVB, generic governance bundles);\n   * organisational libraries extending or subsetting core bundles.\n\n##### E.17.1:4.2.2 - `U.ViewpointBundle` and `ViewFamilyId` (viewpoint family)\n\n**Tech:** `U.ViewpointBundle` (species type), `ViewFamilyId` (lexical id).\n**Plain:** viewpoint family, bundle of viewpoints.\n\nA `U.ViewpointBundle` is a **family of compatible viewpoints** packaged for reuse. Minimal structure:\n\n* `viewFamilyId : ViewFamilyId` — lexical id for the family (e.g. `VF.TEVB.ENG`, `VF.GovRisk`, `VF.ResearchMethod`).\n* `EoIClassSpec ⊑ U.Entity` — class of entities this family is meant for (must be compatible with each viewpoint’s `EoIClassSpec`).\n* `viewpoints : FinSet(U.Viewpoint)` — finite, non‑empty set of `U.Viewpoint` values (typically referenced via `U.ViewpointRef` in episteme cards).\n* optional `ArchetypalCards : FinSet(U.ArchetypalGroundingRef)` — grounding cards per viewpoint (E.7).\n* optional `AlignmentNotes` — e.g., ISO 42010 mappings, domain standard references.\n\n**Normative constraints.**\n\nVBL‑1. **EoIClass compatibility.**\nFor every `vp ∈ viewpoints`:\n\n* `vp` **SHALL** resolve to a `U.Viewpoint` whose `EoIClassSpec` refines `EoIClassSpec` of the bundle (`EoIClassSpec(vp) ⊑ EoIClassSpec(bundle)`).\n\nVBL‑2. **Finite, named family.**\n\n* `viewpoints` **SHALL** be finite and non‑empty.\n* Each `U.Viewpoint` **SHOULD** carry a stable `ViewpointId` (lexical id) distinct from `ViewFamilyId`.\n* The same `U.Viewpoint` **MAY** appear in multiple bundles (e.g. a general “Regulatory” viewpoint in both engineering and governance bundles).\n\nVBL‑3. **Lexical non‑collision.**\n\n* `ViewFamilyId` **MUST NOT** be used as:\n\n  * a `U.ViewId` / `U.ViewFamily(-)` id in MVPK,\n  * a `SurfaceKind` or carrier kind in L‑SURF,\n  * a generic `ViewpointId` without qualifier (E.18:5.12).\n* Libraries **SHOULD** adopt naming schemes that make the distinction clear, e.g. `VF.*` for families, `VP.*` for viewpoints, `PV.*` for publication viewpoints.\n\nVBL‑4. **Intensionality.**\n\n* A `U.ViewpointBundle` is **intensional**: it talks about the family of `U.Viewpoint` specs and their intended use; it does **not** contain any D/S epistemes, `U.View` instances, or `PublicationSurface` artefacts.\n* Any concrete document or MVPK face referencing a family **SHALL** do so through its `ViewFamilyId` and per‑view `ViewpointId`, not by embedding the bundle.\n\n##### E.17.1:4.2.3 - Binding bundles into `U.MultiViewDescribing`\n\n`U.MultiViewDescribing[EoIClass]` organises families of descriptions/specifications for a fixed `<T,C>` (entity, context) with a finite viewpoint set Σ.\n\n**Binding rule (informal).**\n\n* Given a `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` and a bundle with `EoIClassSpec` compatible with the family’s `EoIClass`, a `U.MultiViewDescribing[EoIClass]` instance **MAY** declare:\n\n  * `ViewFamilyId` — the bundle that provides its “canonical” viewpoint set;\n  * `ActiveViewpoints ⊆ viewpoints(bundle)` — the subset actually used in this `<T,C>` family.\n\n**Normative constraints.**\n\nVBL‑5. **Bundle import.**\nFor any `U.MultiViewDescribing[EoIClass]` instance that declares a `ViewFamilyId`:\n\n* its viewpoint set Σ **SHALL** be a finite subset of the `viewpoints` of that bundle;\n* every D/S episteme in the family **SHALL** have `viewpointRef` in Σ (as required by E.17.0 / E.10.D2);\n* every `U.View` attached to that family under E.17.0 **SHALL** preserve `viewpointRef` from Σ.\n\nVBL‑6. **Multi‑bundle coordination.**\nA single `<T,C>` family **MAY** rely on more than one bundle (e.g. TEVB + a safety bundle). In that case:\n\n* the family **SHALL** declare how Σ is partitioned by `ViewFamilyId` (e.g. engineering vs safety);\n* any CorrespondenceModel in the family that links views across families **SHALL** cite the relevant `ViewFamilyId` values.\n\nVBL‑7. **No implicit bundles.**\nIf a `U.MultiViewDescribing` family does **not** declare a `ViewFamilyId`, its Σ is considered **local**. Such families are valid but:\n* provide no guarantee of reuse in other projects;\n* may be required, by organisational policy, to migrate to a library bundle before external publication.\n",

Embedding them into bundles allows assurance‑oriented Viewpoint families to be reused and linked to Part F harnesses and stance declarations (`DesignRunTag`/`Locus`).\n\n* **Governance and research workflows.**\n  Governance / audit frameworks and research pipelines similarly rely on recurring perspectives (e.g. “internal validity”, “external validity”, “reproducibility”). Viewpoint bundles allow these perspectives to be captured once and referenced across many MultiViewDescribing instances.\n\nOverall, `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary` is the mechanism by which **post‑2015 multi‑view practice** (viewpoint libraries, reusable view definitions) is integrated into the FPF stack without compromising strict I/D/S separation or the episteme slot discipline of C.2.1/A.6.5.\n",

Architecture‑focused viewpoint bundles are introduced as separate `U.ViewpointBundle` species that may import TEVB.\n\n**Builds on.**\n* **E.17.0 — `U.MultiViewDescribing`.** Supplies the generic notion of `U.Viewpoint`, `U.View`, and `ViewFamily` over an `EoIClass ⊑ U.Entity` (here: `EoIClass = U.Holon`).\n* **E.17.1 — `U.ViewpointBundleLibrary`.** Provides the generic `U.ViewpointBundle`/`ViewFamilyId` structure; TEVB is a concrete bundle (`VF.TEVB.ENG`) in the core library.\n* **A.1 — Holon.** Holon kinds `U.System` and `U.Episteme` as the typical engineering entities‑of‑interest.\n* **A.6.2–A.6.4 — Episteme morphisms.** `U.EffectFreeEpistemicMorphing`, `U.EpistemicViewing`, `U.EpistemicRetargeting` as the generic morphism classes behind engineering views.\n* **A.7 / E.10.D2 — Strict Distinction & I/D/S.** I/D/S discipline and DescriptionContext; engineering descriptions/specifications under TEVB are D/S‑epistemes with explicit `ViewpointRef`.\n* **C.2.1 — `U.EpistemeSlotGraph`.** Provides `DescribedEntitySlot`, `ViewpointSlot`, `ViewSlot` and the slot discipline (A.6.5) used by TEVB‑aligned descriptions/specs.\n\n**Used by.**\n* **E.18:5.12 — E.TGA viewpoint map.** As a canonical consumer, E.TGA binds its engineering transduction families (Functional, Procedural, Role‑Enactor/Device‑Structure, Module‑Interface) to TEVB viewpoints `VP.Functional`, `VP.Procedural`, `VP.RoleEnactor`, `VP.ModuleInterface`.\n* **E.17 (MVPK).** Publication of engineering morphisms uses TEVB engineering viewpoints on the description/spec side and PublicationVPs on the Surface side.\n* **Engineering description/spec patterns.** System, method, module/interface and role‑related description/spec patterns for holons (`U.System`, `U.Episteme`) refer to TEVB when declaring their `ViewpointRef`.\n* **ISO‑aligned architecture‑description bundles.** Future species patterns for architecture‑specific viewpoint bundles reuse TEVB as the canonical engineering view family (Functional vs Structural etc.) over systems and their epistemes.\n\n**Guard (lexical & ontological).**\n1. **Engineering scope only.** TEVB applies to `EoIClass = U.Holon` with typical cases `U.System` and `U.Episteme`. Using TEVB viewpoints for non‑holonic entities (e.g., pure data structures, abstract theories) requires an explicit species‑level justification; by default it is a conformance violation.\n2. **Viewpoint vs Surface.** `VP.Functional`, `VP.Procedural`, `VP.RoleEnactor`, `VP.ModuleInterface` are **viewpoints** (intensional `U.Viewpoint` specifications), **not** Surface kinds. They MUST NOT be used as carrier/Surface names (those remain `{PlainView, TechCard, NormsCard, InteropCard, AssuranceLane, …}` under L‑SURF).\n3. **EngineeringVPId vs PublicationVPId.** `VP.*` in this pattern are **EngineeringVPId** values (E.18:5.12) and SHALL NOT be reused as PublicationVPs in MVPK. MVPK must introduce separate `PublicationVPId` symbols, linked to TEVB viewpoints only through correspondences.\n4. **No new role coordinates in I/D/S.** TEVB references stakeholder groups via `U.RoleEnactor` families but does not introduce `U.Role` as a coordinate in I/D/S signatures (E.10.D2). Role semantics remain confined to RoleEnactment patterns (A.15, F‑R family).\n5. **No extra viewpoints inside TEVB.** TEVB defines a **fixed core set** of four engineering viewpoints. Other labels such as “Assurance‑Oriented”, “Interop‑Oriented”, “Information/Data‑Oriented”, “Operational/Deployment”, “Mission/Context” may appear only as **lexical aliases** in E.18:5.12 (e.g. as `ViewFamilyId` / `AliasInViewFamilies` values for transduction species). They MUST NOT extend `TEVB.EngBundle.viewpoints` and MUST NOT be interpreted as additional `U.Viewpoint` kinds in this bundle; when SoTA or local practice demands explicit assurance, information, or mission viewpoints, these SHALL be provided as **separate `U.ViewpointBundle` species** that can be imported alongside TEVB rather than by mutating `VF.TEVB.ENG`.\n6. **Not an architecture framework.** TEVB is an engineering‑level viewpoint bundle; architecture‑specific viewpoint bundles and architecture frameworks MUST be introduced as separate `U.ViewpointBundle` species that may import TEVB. They MUST NOT redefine `VF.TEVB.ENG` as an “architecture viewpoint library” or extend it with architecture‑only viewpoints.\n",
        "problem": "### E.17.2:2 - Problem  *(informative)*\n\nWithout TEVB, several failure modes recur:\n1. **Inconsistent “functional/structural/behavioural” vocabularies.** Different teams define “functional view” or “process view” differently, even within one organisation; E.TGA E.18:5.12 then has to guess how to map transduction graphs onto whichever interpretation is currently in play.\n2. **Architecture frameworks leak into the kernel.** 4+1‑style and similar architectural frameworks get hard‑coded as if they were universal; FPF loses its holonic neutrality and becomes biased to a particular school.\n3. **Viewpoints conflated with surfaces and files.** “Functional view” is used both for the underlying viewpoint and for a concrete document or dashboard; MVPK faces, E.TGA transduction families, and I/D/S disciplines become entangled.\n4. **Role leakage into I/D/S.** Engineering views that are about role‑enactors are written directly in terms of `U.Role`, blurring the boundary between RoleEnactment (A.15) and description/spec layers, and breaking A.7/E.10.D2.\n5. **Poor reuse across systems.** Even when organisations want to reuse the same engineering views across products, plants, or models, there is no canonical bundle to import; each programme recreates “its own” functional/structural views.\n\nTEVB makes engineering viewpoint families **first‑class reusable bundles** and pins them to an explicit `EoIClass` (engineering holons) so that E.TGA, MVPK and discipline‑packs can align on the same vocabulary.\n",

        "solution": "### E.17.2:4 - Solution — TEVB as a core `U.ViewpointBundle` for holons  *(normative)*\n\n#### E.17.2:4.1 - TEVB bundle identity\n\nTEVB is the **core engineering viewpoint bundle** over holons.\n\n* **Bundle object.** There exists a canonical `U.ViewpointBundle` instance:\n\n  ```\n  TEVB.EngBundle : U.ViewpointBundle\n  ```\n\n* **ViewFamilyId.**\n\n  ```\n  TEVB.EngBundle.viewFamilyId = VF.TEVB.ENG\n  ```\n\n  `VF.TEVB.ENG` is reserved for **“Typical Engineering Viewpoints (Engineering)”** in the FPF core ViewpointBundleLibrary.\n\n* **EoIClassSpec (holon scope).**\n\n  TEVB is parameterised by\n\n  ```\n  TEVB.EngBundle.EoIClassSpec =\n    { h : U.Holon | holonKind(h) ∈ {U.System, U.Episteme} }\n  ```\n\n  That is, TEVB applies to holons that are either `U.System` or `U.Episteme`. Other holon kinds MAY be added by species patterns but MUST be justified and documented; the default conformance profile assumes systems and epistemes.\n\n* **Library placement.**\n\n  TEVB lives in the core viewpoint library:\n\n  ```\n  TEVB.Library : U.ViewpointBundleLibrary\n  TEVB.Library.libraryId = FPF.Core.Viewpoints\n  TEVB.Library.bundles ⊇ { TEVB.EngBundle }\n  ```\n\n  Additional organisational libraries MAY import and specialise TEVB, but SHALL NOT redefine `VF.TEVB.ENG` with incompatible semantics.\n\n* **Viewpoint set.**\n\n  TEVB defines a **finite set of canonical engineering viewpoints**:\n\n  ```\n  TEVB.EngBundle.viewpoints =\n    { VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface }\n  ```\n\nThe selection `{VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}` is the current **NQD‑frontier** for engineering holon viewpoints in Part G: it realises a Function–Behaviour–Structure‑plus‑Role (`F–B–S+R`) cut that is non‑dominated against candidate families including explicit information/data, assurance/safety, and mission/context viewpoints under the N/U/C/D axes (C.18, G.0). Part G records the SoTA candidate set and rejected alternatives; TEVB only fixes the **core four** where each `VP.* : U.Viewpoint` is defined below. These four are the **only** viewpoints in the core TEVB bundle.\n\n  > **Note.** Other ViewFamilyId values used in E.TGA (e.g., *Assurance‑Oriented*, *Interoperability‑Oriented*, *Information/Data‑Oriented*, *Operational/Deployment*, *Mission/Context*) remain **lexical families only** for transduction species (E.18:5.12). They do not add viewpoints to TEVB; they are orthogonal to TEVB’s `viewpoints` set.\n\n#### E.17.2:4.2 - TEVB engineering viewpoints\n\nEach TEVB viewpoint is a `U.Viewpoint` with:\n* `viewpointId : ViewpointId` (concrete identifier, e.g., `VP.Functional`);\n* `EoIClassSpec` **inherited from the bundle** (`U.Holon` with `System`/`Episteme` kinds);\n* `StakeholderFamilies : FinSet(RoleEnactorFamilyId)` — families of `U.RoleEnactor` that are the primary audience;\n* `Concerns : FinSet(ConcernId)` — engineering concerns this viewpoint foregrounds;\n* `AllowedEpistemeKinds : FinSet(U.EpistemeKindRef)` — description/spec kinds admissible under this viewpoint (all obeying I/D/S discipline and C.2.1 slot discipline);\n* `ConformanceRules : FinSet(RuleId)` — references to checklist items in conformance packs (CV/GF/engineering checklists).\n\nThe subsections below fix the **normative intent and minimal field profiles** for each TEVB viewpoint. Species patterns and discipline‑packs may refine `Concerns`, `AllowedEpistemeKinds` and `ConformanceRules`, but MUST preserve the intent.\n\n##### E.17.2:4.2.1 - `VP.Functional` — capability & transduction viewpoint\n\n**Intent.** Look at a holon in terms of **what it can do** under roles: capabilities, transductions, and functional responsibilities, rather than in terms of modules or procedures.\n\n* **viewpointId.**\n\n  ```\n  VP.Functional : ViewpointId  // EngineeringVPId\n  ```\n\n* **EoIClassSpec.**\n  Same as the bundle: `U.Holon` with `System`/`Episteme` kinds.\n\n* **StakeholderFamilies (typical examples).**\n  Actual `StakeholderFamilies : FinSet(U.RoleEnactor)` values are defined in RoleEnactment discipline packs; labels below are informal.\n  * System engineering leads and architects (e.g. SysEng‑lead enactors).\n  * Product owners / capability owners.\n  * Reliability / performance engineers when reading capability envelopes.\n\n* **Concerns (typical).**\n  * Capabilities and functions provided by the holon (`CapabilityConcerns`).\n  * Behaviour under roles (`RoleBehaviourConcerns`).\n  * Non‑functional envelopes: throughput, latency, availability, energy, safety (`NFPEnvelopeConcerns`).\n  * Compositional semantics of functions/transductions (`TransductionCompositionConcerns`).\n\n* **AllowedEpistemeKinds (shape).**\n  `VP.Functional` admits descriptions/specifications whose **DescribedEntitySlot** is a holon’s **capability/Method/Mechanism** under a role, e.g.:\n  * `SystemFunctionalDescription`, `SystemFunctionalSpec` (species of `U.EpistemeKind` describing system‑level capabilities and their interconnection).\n  * `TransductionDescription`, `TransductionSpec` (E.TGA functional lanes).\n  * `ServiceCapabilityDescription`, `ServiceCapabilitySpec` (when a holon is in Service role).\n\n  All such epistemes MUST:\n  * obey I/D/S discipline: `…Description`/`…Spec` as D/S‑layers for `U.Method`/`U.Mechanism`/`U.ServiceClause`;\n  * make their `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` explicit, with `ViewpointRef = VP.Functional`.\n\n* **ConformanceRules (examples).**\n  * Functional flows are **total** over their declared domain (no implicit dangling capabilities).\n  * Transductions are typed at interfaces (A.6.0, A.6.1) and respect A.6.2/A.6.3 purity/conservativity.\n  * When functional views participate in retargeting patterns (e.g. structural reinterpretation species based on `U.EpistemicRetargeting`), they MUST satisfy the relevant retargeting constraints from A.6.4; concrete consumer patterns (such as E.TGA structural reinterpretation, E.18) MAY impose additional rules.\n\n* **SoTA echo (informative).** `VP.Functional` corresponds to the “functional view” in ISO‑aligned architecture descriptions and domain reference architectures (functional viewpoints in IoT and space reference architectures, functional/logical layers in sector frameworks), and to the **Function** axis in FBS‑style design ontologies. It is also the natural home for SysML/SysML‑v2 capability and logical architecture models and for “logical view” slices in 4+1‑style frameworks, once recast into holon/capability terms.\n\n##### E.17.2:4.2.2 - `VP.Procedural` — process & control viewpoint\n\n**Intent.** Look at a holon in terms of **how behaviours are sequenced and controlled**: workflows, state machines, operational procedures, and control logic.\n\n* **viewpointId.**\n\n  ```\n  VP.Procedural : ViewpointId  // EngineeringVPId\n  ```\n\n* **EoIClassSpec.**\n\n  Same as the bundle.\n\n* **StakeholderFamilies (typical).**\n  * Operations and run‑time owners (`OperationsEnactorFamily`).\n  * Control engineers and automation specialists (`ControlEngineerEnactorFamily`).\n  * Safety engineers concerned with procedural correctness (`SafetyEngineerEnactorFamily`).\n\n* **Concerns (typical).**\n  * Control flow and ordering of actions (`OrderConcerns`).\n  * State‑machine behaviour and lifecycle (`StateLifecycleConcerns`).\n  * Concurrency, synchronisation, and error handling (`ConcurrencyConcerns`).\n  * Operational modes and transitions (startup, shutdown, degraded modes) (`OperationalModeConcerns`).\n\n* **AllowedEpistemeKinds (shape).**\n  `VP.Procedural` admits descriptions/specifications where the **DescribedEntitySlot** is a method/process/control Behaviour for the holon, e.g.:\n  * `MethodDescription`, `MethodSpec` for operational procedures (A.3.1–A.3.2).\n  * `ControlLogicDescription`, `ControlLogicSpec` (IEC 61131‑3 style step diagrams/statecharts).\n  * `WorkflowDescription`, `WorkflowSpec` (business processes, orchestration logic).\n\n  These epistemes:\n  * must respect the **order discipline** (Γ_method, Γ_ctx) and A.15 (Role–Method–Work alignment);\n  * must carry I/D/S‑conformant DescriptionContext with `ViewpointRef = VP.Procedural`.\n\n* **ConformanceRules (examples).**\n  * Pre/post‑conditions at step boundaries are explicit and type‑checked (A.3.1/A.3.2, Γ_method).\n  * No embedding of Work or calendars inside procedural descriptions (A.7/E.10.D2).\n  * Failure modes and recovery actions are declared and traceable to safety analyses (F.15 harnesses where relevant).\n\n* **SoTA echo (informative).** `VP.Procedural` captures the dynamic/process dimension found in SoTA architecture and MBSE practice: process views in 4+1, operational/behavioural views in defence and enterprise frameworks, behaviour diagrams in SysML (activity, sequence, state, interaction), and procedure/control‑oriented models in industrial standards. TEVB abstracts this into a notation‑agnostic “behaviour over time” viewpoint for holons.\n\n##### E.17.2:4.2.3 - `VP.RoleEnactor` — role & device‑structure viewpoint\n\n**Intent.** Look at a holon in terms of **who/what plays which roles** and **how physical/organisational structure supports those roles**. This viewpoint covers both socio‑technical role assignments and “device view” readings of transduction graphs (E.TGA).\n\n* **viewpointId.**\n\n  ```\n  VP.RoleEnactor : ViewpointId  // EngineeringVPId\n  ```\n\n* **EoIClassSpec.**\n\n  Same as the bundle.\n\n* **StakeholderFamilies (typical).**\n  * Organisational designers and operations managers (`OrgDesignEnactorFamily`).\n  * Safety and compliance officers concerned with separation of duties (`SegregationOfDutyEnactorFamily`).\n  * Hardware/system engineers concerned with which devices carry which functions (`DeviceEngineerEnactorFamily`).\n\n* **Concerns (typical).**\n  * Which holons enact which roles under which contexts (`RoleEnactmentConcerns`).\n  * Allocation of capabilities to devices/subsystems (`CapabilityAllocationConcerns`).\n  * Organisational constraints: segregation of duties, responsibilities, escalation paths (`GovernanceConcerns`).\n  * Device‑view readings of functional graphs (E.TGA Device‑View).\n\n* **AllowedEpistemeKinds (shape).**\n  `VP.RoleEnactor` admits descriptions/specifications where the **DescribedEntitySlot** is a **role structure or capability allocation** associated with the holon, e.g.:\n  * `RoleDescription`, `RoleSpec` (F.4, F.18) for human or system roles.\n  * `RoleEnactmentDescription` for mappings `Holder#Role:Context` (A.15).\n  * `DeviceAllocationDescription` mapping functions/transductions to physical modules or devices.\n\n  As with other TEVB viewpoints, these are D/S‑epistemes with `DescriptionContext.ViewpointRef = VP.RoleEnactor`.\n\n* **ConformanceRules (examples).**\n  * Role vs Method vs Work vs Capability separation is upheld (A.7, A.15).\n  * Device‑view reinterpretation from functional flows MUST be expressed as `U.EpistemicRetargeting` with an explicit `KindBridge` witness (A.6.4). Specific retargeting schemes (for example, E.TGA’s structural reinterpretation in E.18) may add further constraints but are not fixed by TEVB itself.\n  * No “role as behaviour” conflation: Roles are masks, behaviours remain Methods/Work.\n\n* **SoTA echo (informative).** `VP.RoleEnactor` aligns with the allocation/responsibility and resource/organisational view clusters seen across MBSE frameworks: allocation views in UAF/NAF, role‑responsibility matrices and RACI‑style artefacts, and “who/what plays which role” slices in usage and operational viewpoints. Many post‑2015 reference architectures treat this axis implicitly; TEVB makes it explicit and holon‑centred while remaining compatible with socio‑technical and device‑allocation practices.\n\n##### E.17.2:4.2.4 - `VP.ModuleInterface` — module & interface viewpoint\n\n**Intent.** Look at a holon in terms of its **modules, interfaces, and structural composition**: what parts exist, how they connect, and how their contracts are specified.\n\n* **viewpointId.**\n\n  ```\n  VP.ModuleInterface : ViewpointId  // EngineeringVPId\n  ```\n\n* **EoIClassSpec.**\n  Same as the bundle.\n\n* **StakeholderFamilies (typical).**\n  * Hardware and software architects responsible for structure (`StructureArchitectEnactorFamily`).\n  * Integration and test engineers (`IntegrationEngineerEnactorFamily`).\n  * Lifecycle and maintenance planners looking at replaceable units (`MaintenancePlannerEnactorFamily`).\n\n* **Concerns (typical).**\n  * Module decomposition and containment (mereology) (`ModuleMereologyConcerns`).\n  * Interfaces and contracts — ports, APIs, physical connectors (`InterfaceConcerns`).\n  * Dependency structures and allowed couplings (`DependencyConcerns`).\n  * Replaceability and variation points (`VariabilityConcerns`).\n\n* **AllowedEpistemeKinds (shape).**\n  `VP.ModuleInterface` admits descriptions/specifications where the **DescribedEntitySlot** is a **structural architecture** of the holon, e.g.:\n  * `SystemStructureDescription`, `SystemStructureSpec` (module/connector descriptions).\n  * `ModuleInterfaceDescription`, `ModuleInterfaceSpec` (signature, contracts, physical interface definitions).\n  * E.TGA‑style interface/port descriptions over `Signature`/`Mechanism` graphs.\n\n  These epistemes describe the carrier (structure) rather than capability. Functional↔physical reinterpretations between `VP.Functional` and `VP.ModuleInterface` are expressed via `U.EpistemicRetargeting` + `KindBridge` (A.6.4, E.18).\n\n* **ConformanceRules (examples).**\n  * Interfaces are typed and explicitly bound to standards where applicable (A.6.0, F‑specs).\n  * No inlining of Methods/Work into structure (strict separation of structure vs behaviour).\n  * Reinterpretations from functional views into structure MUST respect the applicable `U.EpistemicRetargeting`/Bridge constraints (A.6.4). When combined with a concrete retargeting scheme (e.g. E.TGA structural retargeting, CC‑TGA‑06‑EX), that scheme’s additional rules also apply.\n\n* **SoTA echo (informative).** `VP.ModuleInterface` matches the structural/implementation/deployment families that dominate SoTA architecture descriptions: development and physical views in 4+1, construction/deployment viewpoints in IoT reference architectures, logical/physical architecture layers in UAF/NAF and RASDS‑style frameworks, and structural and interface‑focused models in SysML‑based MBSE. TEVB treats all of these as specialisations of a single holonic “modules and interfaces” viewpoint.\n",
        "archetypal_grounding": "### E.17.2:5 - Archetypal grounding  *(informative)*\n\nA minimal TEVB instantiation looks as follows:\n\n```\nTEVB.EngBundle :\n  U.ViewpointBundle {\n    viewFamilyId   = VF.TEVB.ENG\n    EoIClassSpec   = { h : U.Holon | HolonKind(h) ∈ {System, Episteme} }\n    viewpoints     = { VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface }\n    LibraryRef     = FPF.Core.Viewpoints\n  }\n```\n\nEach `VP.*` viewpoint is a `U.Viewpoint` as in E.17.0, with:\n\n* `viewpointId ∈ {VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}`,\n* `EoIClassSpec` inherited from `TEVB.EngBundle`,\n* `StakeholderFamilies`, `Concerns`, `AllowedEpistemeKinds`, `ConformanceRules` aligned with the subsections above.\n\n**Engineering holon (example).**\n\nLet `Plant_X : U.System` be a production plant, and `ControlStack_X : U.Episteme` be its control and optimisation stack as a holon.\n\n* Under `VP.Functional`, `Plant_X` is viewed as a bundle of capabilities and transductions: material/energy/product flows, optimisation functions, safety envelopes.\n* Under `VP.Procedural`, `Plant_X` is viewed as sets of procedures and control sequences: startup/shutdown, normal operation, emergency handling.\n* Under `VP.RoleEnactor`, `Plant_X` is viewed as networks of role‑enactors: human operators, controllers, subsystems enacting roles in SOPs and safety cases.\n* Under `VP.ModuleInterface`, `Plant_X` is viewed as modules and interfaces: equipment units, pipelines, control modules, buses, and their interfaces/contracts.\n\nEach of these is a **family of D/S‑epistemes** with `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef(Plant_X or ControlStack_X), BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef=VP.*⟩` and TEVB ensures that E.TGA and MVPK can rely on this common structure.\n",

        "rationale": "### E.17.2:7 - Rationale & SoTA echoing  *(informative)*\n\n#### E.17.2:7.1 - NQD‑grounded choice of the core four\n\nPart G’s NQD discipline treats candidate viewpoint families as points in an N/U/C/D quality space (Use‑Value, Constraint‑Fit, Novelty, Diversity_P). Applied to a SoTA‑harvested candidate set of engineering viewpoints (Functional, Behavioural/Procedural, Structural/Module, Allocation/Role, Information/Data, Assurance/Safety, Mission/Context, Deployment/Operational, Business/Usage), this yields a small Pareto frontier for *engineering holon* viewpoints. On that frontier, the `F–B–S+R` cut implemented by `{VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}` is the minimal set that:\n* spans the Function–Behaviour–Structure ontology used in contemporary design theory while adding an explicit allocation/responsibility axis;  \n* aligns with the “functional/process/structural/deployment” clusters recurrent in standards and architecture frameworks;  \n* stays neutral with respect to domain‑specific qualities (`‑ilities`) and business/mission framing, which are captured in separate Q‑bundles and governance/viewpoint packs rather than in TEVB itself.\n\nOther candidates (e.g. dedicated information, assurance, or mission viewpoints) remain important but either duplicate concerns already captured by TEVB (when specialised to engineering holons) or are better modelled as orthogonal quality bundles (C.25) or non‑engineering bundles (business/governance packs). TEVB therefore pins only the core four and leaves the rest to specialised families.\n\n#### E.17.2:7.2 - Alignment with post‑2015 engineering practice\n\n* Modern architecture standards built on ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 describe viewpoint libraries in which functional, behavioural/process, structural/deployment, and business/usage concerns are the dominant clusters; sector RAs such as IoT RA 30141 and space‑domain RAs provide explicit functional and construction/implementation viewpoints alongside business/usage and trustworthiness viewpoints. TEVB reuses the functional and construction/structural clusters as `VP.Functional` and `VP.ModuleInterface`, while treating business and trustworthiness as separate bundles.  \n* Model‑based systems engineering practice (INCOSE MBSE guidance, SysML v2 “views‑as‑queries”, UAF/NAF view grids) converges on a small set of core diagram families: structure vs behaviour vs allocation/responsibility vs requirements/mission. TEVB’s `VP.Procedural` and `VP.RoleEnactor` correspond to the behaviour and allocation/responsibility axes, respectively, and are designed to be notation‑neutral over SysML/UAF/UML/Capella‑style models.  \n* The FBS family of design ontologies (Function–Behaviour–Structure and extensions) provides a widely used conceptual basis for separating what a system is for, what it does over time, and what it consists of. TEVB’s four viewpoints intentionally implement an FBS+R split at the holon level: `VP.Functional` ≈ Function, `VP.Procedural` ≈ Behaviour, `VP.ModuleInterface` ≈ Structure, with `VP.RoleEnactor` capturing the explicit mapping from functions/behaviours to role‑enacting carriers.  \n* Within FPF itself, E.TGA’s “viewpoint families” (Functional, Procedural, Role‑Enactor/Device‑Structure, Module‑Interface, plus assurance/interoperability/data/operational/mission aliases) are harmonised by letting the **core four** be TEVB viewpoints and treating the rest as lexical or bundle‑level overlays, not as new kernel viewpoints.\n\n#### E.17.2:7.3 - Why TEVB stays small\n\nTEVB is deliberately *not* a complete architecture framework. It gives FPF a stable, holon‑centred engineering bundle that:\n* is small enough to keep in working memory and to govern via EpistemeSlotGraph discipline;  \n* is expressive enough to host mappings from SoTA architecture frameworks (4+1, domain‑specific RAs, UAF/NAF grids, SysML‑based MBSE method kits);  \n* can be safely combined with additional `U.ViewpointBundle` species (safety/assurance packs, business/mission packs, information/data packs) without mutating the core four;\n* sits conceptually **below** architecture‑specific viewpoint libraries, which are introduced as separate `U.ViewpointBundle` species layering TEVB with mission/quality/business viewpoints instead of redefining TEVB.\n\nAs SoTA evolves, new bundles can be added or TEVB can gain a new edition with a revised NQD‑frontier, but the TEVB‑A edition fixed here remains the archetypal engineering bundle for holons.\n",

        "intent": "### E.17:1 - Intent\n\nProvide a **disciplined, compositional way to publish morphisms** (arrows) across multiple didactic faces (views/cards) **without adding semantics**, while keeping **viewpoints** (the specifications that constrain views) explicit and auditable. Authors get a small **view‑pack** that, when applied to any `U.Morphism` (including compositions), yields a **family of views** that commute with arrow composition and respect edition/measurement pinning (Part F/G).\n",
        "problem": "### E.17:3 - Problem\n\n1. **Semantic drift in publication.** Unchecked “presentations” introduce claims not present in the D/S‑epistemes about the arrow (epistemes with `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩` in the sense of E.10.D2/E.17.0).    \n2. **Non‑compositionality.** Publishing `g∘f` yields surfaces that don’t match composing the surfaces of `f` and `g`.    \n3. **View vs viewpoint confusion.** A single template is treated as “the view”, with no declared concerns or conformance rules.    \n4. **Unpinned numbers.** Numeric claims lack unit/scale/reference‑plane and **edition pins** (Part F/G), undermining auditability.    \n",

        "solution": "### E.17:5 - Solution — the **MVPK Kit**\n\n#### E.17:5.0 - USM anchoring (normative)\n* **PublicationScope (USM).** `U.PublicationScope` is defined in **USM** (A.2.6 §6.5) analogously to `U.WorkScope` and `U.ClaimScope` as a **set‑valued scope object** over `U.ContextSlice`. In MVPK, every emitted `U.View` SHALL declare a `U.PublicationScope` that bounds where that face is admissible.  \n  * **Non‑overload rule.** `U.PublicationScope` MUST NOT encode viewpoint choice, MVPK profile selection, or Publication Characteristics (PC); those are governed by `PublicationVPId`/`U.Viewpoint` and MVPK profile rules (§5.1/§5.2/§5.5).\n* **Scope lineage.** `U.PublicationScope` participates in the same USM lineage regime as `U.WorkScope`/`U.ClaimScope` (Δ‑moves, editioning and migration rules); MVPK emits faces **under** a declared `PublicationScopeId`.\n* **MVPK profile (kit configuration).** The canonical MVPK profiles (MVPK‑Min/Lite/SetReady/Max) fix:\n  * (a) the **viewpoint index** `Σ` and its partial order `⪯`,\n  * (b) the admissible **Publication characteristics (PC)** and required **pinning contracts**,\n  * (c) any cross‑Context/plane constraints (Bridge/CL policies) applicable to emitted faces.\n* **L, P, D, E quartet.** The canonical MVPK‑Max profile enumerates exactly four **face kinds**: `PlainView (P)`, `TechCard (T)`, `InteropCard (I)`, `AssuranceLane (A)`. If a program elects to retain the mnemonic **(L, P, D, E)** tuple, it MUST map it 1‑to‑1 onto these **face kinds** and SHALL NOT introduce additional kinds without a USM extension.\n\n#### E.17:5.1 - Terminology (normative)\n\n* **View** (`U.View`): an episteme‑level view (`U.EpistemeView` in the sense of C.2.1/E.17.0) produced *under* a publication viewpoint. In MVPK each face (`PlainView`, `TechCard`, `InteropCard`, `AssuranceLane`) is such a `U.View` whose `DescribedEntitySlot`/`DescriptionContext` target is a `U.Morphism` and whose `viewpointRef` is a publication `U.Viewpoint`.  \n  Every MVPK `U.View` **SHALL** declare:  \n  `SurfaceKind ∈ {PublicationSurface, InteropSurface}`, `PublicationVPId : U.ViewpointRef`, references to the underlying D/S‑epistemes produced by `Describe_ID`/`Specify_DS` in A.7/E.10.D2, and a `U.PublicationScope` (USM §6.5).  \n  Any materialization/rendering is separate **Work on SCR/RSCR carriers** and is not part of `U.View`.\n* **Publication vs presentation vs rendering vs representation (guard):**    \n    * **Publication** = typed projection from existing D/S‑epistemes about a morphism onto a `U.View`/`PublicationSurface` via species of `U.EpistemicViewing` (A.6.3) under the I/D/S discipline of A.7/E.10.D2.        \n    * **Presentation** = rhetorical arrangement of a published carrier; **notation‑neutral**, adds no claims and is **not** a Surface kind.        \n    * **Rendering** = display/layout of a carrier, purely graphical/formatting; **Work on carriers** (A.7), not a Surface kind.        \n    * **Representation** = episteme↔referent relation (C.2.1/A.6.2–A.6.4); **not** a surface act. Use **publication** and **view** here; treat presentation/rendering as **Work on carriers** (A.7).\n* **ISO mapping note.** ISO **viewpoint** → `PublicationVPId` (publication layer); **engineering viewpoint** → `EngineeringVPId` (E.TGA E.18:5.12). An ISO **view** may be a single MVPK face; “bundles” are packaging only.\n* **No‑mechanism equivalence:** MVPK **is not** a mechanism; any operational toil (build/render/upload) is **separate Work by a system on carriers** (A.7; see **Laws 5 — No Γ‑leakage** in §6).\n* **ViewpointSpec (`U.Viewpoint`)** — a typed specification that declares stakeholders, concerns, conformance rules, allowed **Publication Characteristics**, and pinning requirements per profile. The index set `Σ` consists of identifiers of `U.Viewpoint` instances, typically drawn from `U.ViewpointBundle` species (E.17.1/E.17.2) (see §5.3).\n\n#### E.17:5.2 - Allowed surfaces at Part E (L‑SURF discipline)\nPart E restricts the term *Surface* to **PublicationSurface** and **InteropSurface**. Concrete faces SHALL be named **…View / …Card / …Lane**. \n\n**USM linkage (normative).** Every `U.View` **SHALL** declare a `U.PublicationScope` (USM §6.5).  \nFor a view **about an episteme** `E`: `PublicationScope(view_E) ⊆ ClaimScope(E)`.  \nFor a view **about a capability** `C`: `PublicationScope(view_C) ⊆ WorkScope(C)`.  \nCross‑context views **SHALL** cite Bridge + CL; **CL penalties apply to R only** (scope membership unchanged).\n\n**L‑PUBSURF naming discipline**\n * Allowed surface kinds: **PublicationSurface**, **InteropSurface**.\n * Concrete faces MUST be named **…View / …Card / …Lane**.\n* The tokens **carrier/bearer/holder** MUST NOT name a `U.View` or any publication entity.  \n  Use **`U.View`** (PlainView / TechCard / InteropCard / AssuranceLane) for conceptual publication faces.  \n  Reserve **carrier** exclusively for **SCR/RSCR** (symbol/document/data carriers) and **Work on carriers**.\n* Avoid geometric metaphors (axis/dimension) for publication artifacts; use **Characteristic/CharacteristicSpace** only when referring to CHR‑MM entities.\n* **Non‑collision guard.** `ViewFamilyId` (lexical tag for viewpoint families) MUST NOT be used to name any `U.View` or surface kind; MVPK face kinds remain **{PlainView, TechCard, InteropCard, AssuranceLane}** only.\n\n**MVPK‑Max viewpoints (normative; exactly four; governed by the MVPK profile):**\n* `PlainView` (explanatory prose view)    \n* `TechCard` (typed catalog card)    \n* `AssuranceLane` (evidence bindings/lanes)\n* `InteropCard` (conceptual interoperability view; **mapping to concrete exchange formats lives in Annex/Interop; Part E does not specify schemas**)\n\n**Lean profiles (small‑team friendly, optional; as MVPK kit profiles):**\n* **MVPK‑Min (F0–F1):** Σ = {`PlainView`, `TechCard‑Lite`}. `AssuranceLane` omitted. No interop face.\n* **MVPK‑Lite (F1–F3):** Σ = {`PlainView`, `TechCard‑Lite`, `AssuranceLane‑Lite` gated by crossing trigger}. `InteropCard` only if external consumers exist.\n* **MVPK‑SetReady (F3–F5):** add `InteropCard` when replayability or external interchange is required (details outside Part E).\n* **Profile‑upgrade triggers:** (i) cross‑Context/plane reuse; (ii) QD/OEE replay needs; (iii) external consumption.\n* **“‑Lite” variants (definition):** A *‑Lite* face removes optional fields only (never claims), keeps the same typing as its full counterpart, and MUST retain pins for any numeric content. Upgrading from *‑Lite* to full is a monotone **add‑fields** operation (no retractions).\n\n#### E.17:5.3 - The kit (constructs)\n\n1. **Object component** `ViewObj_s` for each viewpoint (see §5.1), to make types explicit.  \n2. **Viewpoint set** `Σ : FinSet(U.Viewpoint)` with declared **partial order** `⪯` for formality/refinement (default chain: `PlainView ⪯ TechCard ⪯ InteropCard`; `AssuranceLane` is **orthogonal** and not ordered with respect to others).  \n3. **Emitters** `Emit_s(-) : U.Morphism → U.ViewMorph_s` (one per `s ∈ Σ`).\n4. **Coherence** (laws §6) + **Pin Characteristics** policy (UnitType/ScaleKind/ReferencePlane/EditionId) for any numeric/comparable content, grounded in CHR/UNM.    \n5. **Interop anchors (conceptual)** for `InteropCard` (concerns/semantics only); **any concrete schema/exchange mapping is outside Part E** (Annex/Interop).\n\n**Result:** `MVPK(f, Σ)` returns `U.ViewFamily(f)` whose components are `Emit_s(f)`. Reindexing across `s ⪯ t` is mediated by total object‑level coercions `PromoteView[s→t]_X` (see §6.2).\n\n#### E.17:5.4 - Intensional I/O vs Publication (normative convention)\n1) **I/O are intensional.** The **Input/Output** sections of a morphism describe **intensional** data types (I/D/S) only; they do **not** depend on any publication face.  \n2) **No duplication on faces.** MVPK faces **do not duplicate** I/O lists; they publish a **minimal profile**: **presence‑pins**, **CG‑Spec/CHR anchors**, and **EditionId** only.  \n3) **Signature reserved to intensional.** Use **“Signature”** exclusively for intensional objects (`U.Signature`, `U.PrincipleFrame`, …). On faces, avoid “signature” and use **TechName/PlainName**.  \n4) **Lawful orders, return sets.** Whenever a face shows **selection or comparison**, it **returns sets / lawful partial orders** and **never hides scalarization**; cite a **ComparatorSetRef** for any total order.  \n5) **Bridge routing, penalties.** Crossings go via **Bridge + CL**; publish **Φ(CL)/Φ_plane** ids; penalties route to **R only** (never F/G).  \n6) **Carrier anchoring & lanes.** On first mention, anchor carriers (**SCR/RSCR**); keep **Work occurrences** distinct from **epistemic claims** via lanes.  \n7) **Publication ≠ execution.** No time/resource semantics on faces; any build/render/upload is separate **Work**.\n\n#### E.17:5.5 - Pin & Publication characteristics (normative; never “axes”)\n**Intent.** Make pinning and publication‑time measurement claims explicit, typed, and auditable without importing geometric metaphors. This section introduces **Publication characteristics** (PC) as CHR‑grounded, publication‑level facets that can legally appear on MVPK faces.\n\n**Terminology (aligned with CHR‑MM & UNM).**\n* **Characteristic** (`U.Characteristic`): a measured aspect as defined in CHR‑MM (entity/relation characteristic with a chosen **Scale**).  \n* **CharacteristicSpace** (`U.CharacteristicSpace`): a CHR‑typed product of slots used by dynamics/measurement theories (A.19).  \n* **Publication characteristic** (`U.PubCharacteristic`, **PC**): a **declarative facet** that a view/card/lane may expose *about a morphism* under a stated **Viewpoint**. Each PC is **backed by** CHR/CG‑Spec artifacts and **pinned** by {unit/scale/reference‑plane/edition}. PCs are **not** geometry and do **not** define “axes”.\n\n**PC catalog (initial set).** MVPK defines a minimal open set of PCs that are frequently surfaced:\n* **PC.Number** — numeric/comparable entries (thresholds, budgets, counts). **Pins required:** unit, scale, reference‑plane, edition.  \n* **PC.EvidenceBinding** — bindings to evidence carriers and policies (e.g., PathSliceId, BridgeId, CL notes).  \n* **PC.ComparatorSetRef** — an explicit comparator family for lawful partial orders on faces.  \n* **PC.CharacteristicSpaceRef?** — optional pointer when a face needs to cite the **space** in which a claim is interpreted (e.g., dominance on a declared space).  \nThe catalog **MAY** be extended (see “Extensibility” below); PCs **must** remain declarative (no embedded mechanisms).\n\n**Norms (E17‑PC).**\n* **E17‑PC‑1 (CHR grounding).** Every PC that yields numeric/comparable content **SHALL** cite CHR/CG‑Spec anchors and carry pins {unit, scale, reference‑plane, edition}.  \n* **E17‑PC‑2 (Lexical discipline — no geometry).** Faces and PCs **MUST NOT** use “axis”, “dimension”, or geometric metaphors; use **Characteristic**, **slot**, **CharacteristicSpace** where applicable (**E.10**; see also A.19).  \n* **E17‑PC‑3 (No hidden arithmetic).** Faces **MUST NOT** smuggle aggregation/normalization; any such logic lives in **CG‑Spec** (UNM/NormalizationMethod) and is cited by **…Ref.edition**.  \n* **E17‑PC‑4 (Plane & crossing).** When a PC depends on **ReferencePlane** or crosses planes/contexts, the face **SHALL** cite `BridgeId` and **CL** policy‑ids; penalties route to the **R‑channel only**.  \n* **E17‑PC‑5 (Edition pinning).** PCs that rely on maps or distances **SHALL** pin `DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, and, if used, `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition` / `TransferRulesRef.edition`.  \n* **E17‑PC‑6 (Viewpoint scope).** Each PC instance declares the **Viewpoint** under which it is valid; promotion `PromoteView[s→t]` **MUST NOT** strengthen claims; at most, it reindexes or annotates.  \n* **E17‑PC‑7 (Comparator/SetSemantics edition).** `PC.ComparatorSetRef` and any `SetSemanticsRef` **SHALL carry edition identifiers**; cards MUST be re‑emitted upon edition change with migration notes.\n\n**Surfaces & responsibilities.**\n* **PlainView** MAY include **PC.Number** iff fully pinned; otherwise it uses **compare‑only** language.  \n* **TechCard** SHOULD carry **PC.Number**, **PC.ComparatorSetRef**, and **PC.CharacteristicSpaceRef?** when faces enable lawful ordering.  \n* **AssuranceLane** SHALL carry **PC.EvidenceBinding** and the pins for any numeric claims it relays.  \n* **InteropCard** MAY reference PCs conceptually but SHALL remain notation‑neutral in Part E (schemas map in Annex/Interop).\n\n**Rationale.** MVPK is a publication discipline, not a measurement calculus. By naming **Publication characteristics** and pinning them to CHR/UNM, we:\n1) prevent geometric leakage (no “axes”);  \n2) keep publication neutral yet auditable;  \n3) enable lawful set/ordering behavior on faces via explicit **ComparatorSet**;  \n4) make plane/crossing obligations first‑class and checkable by declared publication checks / **OperationalGate(profile)** GateChecks.\n\n**Extensibility.**\n* **E17‑PC‑Ext‑1 (Open catalog).** New PCs MAY be added under `U.PubCharacteristic` provided they are declarative and CHR/UNM‑grounded.  \n* **E17‑PC‑Ext‑2 (Kinding).** New PCs MUST declare `kind ∈ {Number, EvidenceBinding, SelectorHint, …}` and a **pinning contract**.  \n* **E17‑PC‑Ext‑3 (Twin‑register names).** Supply **Tech** and **Plain** twins; avoid tokens that collide with E.10 bans; do not coin “…Space” names for publication artifacts.  \n* **E17‑PC‑Ext‑4 (Edition discipline).** If a PC depends on a definitional artifact, **edition‑pin** the reference (`…Ref.edition`) and document migration rules.\n\n**Adding invariants (procedure).**\n1) Place **new invariants** for PCs in **CG‑Spec** (S‑layer), not on faces; supply acceptance tests.  \n2) Version any affected **CharacteristicSpace**; publish embeddings if semantics change; never mutate slots in place.  \n3) Update the relevant **GateChecks / GateProfiles** (A.21/A.26; incl. GateCrossing/CrossingSurface checks from **E.18/A.27**) to warn/block on invariant violations; never weaken functorial laws.\n4) **Document** edition/migration rules; extend §9 with a conformance item and provide **Lean‑profile downgrade** (advisory vs block) where applicable.\n\n#### E.17:5.6 - Author ergonomics (non‑normative)\n*Quick path for authors (three steps and a micro‑template):*\n1. **Declare Σ and profile.** Choose `{PlainView, TechCard, …}` and whether faces are full or *‑Lite*.\n2. **Pin once, reuse everywhere.** Attach `{UnitType, ScaleKind, ReferencePlane, EditionId}` to the arrow; cards reference these pins by ID (no duplication).\n3. **Emit & verify.** Generate all faces from the arrow.\n\n*Guidance:* treat *‑Lite* as **field‑drop only**; never add claims in *‑Lite*. \n",
        "laws_(normative)": "### E.17:6 - Laws (normative)\n\nFor any composable arrows `X —f→ Y —g→ Z` in `U`, and any `s, t ∈ Σ_viewpoints`:\n\n1. **Functoriality & typing (per‑viewpoint).**  \n    * (a) **Identity:** `Emit_s(id_X) = id_{ViewObj_s(X)}`.    \n    * (b) **Composition:** `Emit_s(g∘f) = Emit_s(g) ∘ Emit_s(f)`.    \n    * (c) **Typing (totality):** if `f : X → Y` then `Emit_s(f) : ViewObj_s(X) → ViewObj_s(Y)` is **total**; ill‑typed composites must be fixed via `ViewObj_s`, not by weakening laws.    \n    * *Intuition:* every viewpoint acts functorially on arrows; publication does not break arrow algebra.\n2. **Reindexing coherence (monotone refinement + naturality).**    \n    * (a) If `s ⪯ t` then the `t`‑view **refines** the `s`‑view for the same morphism (**no content extension**; increased formality/typing only).    \n    * (b) For each `s ⪯ t` there are **object‑components** `PromoteView[s→t]_X : ViewObj_s(X) → ViewObj_t(X)` natural in `X`, i.e., for every `f : X → Y`  \n      `PromoteView[s→t]_Y ∘ Emit_s(f) = Emit_t(f) ∘ PromoteView[s→t]_X`.    \n    * (c) **Coherence:** `PromoteView[s→s]_X = id_{ViewObj_s(X)}`, and if `s ⪯ t ⪯ u` then `PromoteView[s→u]_X = PromoteView[t→u]_X ∘ PromoteView[s→t]_X` for all `X`.         \n    * *Defaults:* `PlainView ⪯ TechCard ⪯ InteropCard`.    \n    * *Note:* `AssuranceLane` is **orthogonal** to the chain; it binds **evidence‑about‑claims** and MUST NOT introduce new claims **of** the morphism. \n3. **D/S sourcing & EpistemicViewing compatibility (A.7/E.10.D2, A.6.2–A.6.3, E.17.0).**    \n    * (a) Inputs to `Emit_s(-)` are **existing D/S‑epistemes** about the same arrow (for example, `MethodDescription`, `MethodSpec`) produced by `Describe_ID` and `Specify_DS`/`Formalize_DS` in A.7/E.10.D2.

Publication adds no new commitments beyond what is present in the referenced D/S‑epistemes.  \n    * (c) Edition governance respects `U.EditionSeries`/UTS; rows remain the identity anchors for names; MVPK faces MUST be (re‑)emitted when the underlying D/S editions change.\n4. **Pin discipline (Part F/G).**  \n     * Any numeric/comparable content in a view SHALL pin {UnitType, ScaleKind, ReferencePlane}. **EditionId MAY be coarse at Lean profiles**; if units/scale are unknown, **declare ordinal/compare‑only** and **forbid arithmetic** until CHR pins are available.

Such crossings MUST be explicit on `TechCard` and `AssuranceLane`.\n9. **Totality of publication morphisms.**    \n    * Publication maps are total on their domains; when a composition in a view would be ill‑typed, the author **must** fix the object mapping (via `ViewObj_s`) rather than weakening functoriality or reindexing laws.\n10. **PublicationScope discipline (subset & composition).**  \n    * (a) **Subset law:** If a view `v` is about episteme `E` then `PublicationScope(v) ⊆ ClaimScope(E)`; if about capability `C` then `PublicationScope(v) ⊆ WorkScope(C)`.  \n    * (b) **No widening by refinement:** If `s ⪯ t`, then promotion `PromoteView[s→t]` MUST NOT widen `PublicationScope`.  \n    * (c) **Compositional bound:** For composable arrows `X —f→ Y —g→ Z`,  \n      `PublicationScope(Emit_s(g∘f)) ⊆ PublicationScope(Emit_s(g)) ∩ PublicationScope(Emit_s(f))`.\n",

Common specialisations **include but are not limited to** the assignment’s set: `U.FormalSubstrate`, `U.PrincipleFrame`, `U.Mechanism`, `U.ContextNormalization (UNM)`, `U.SelectionAndTuning`, `U.WorkPlanning`, `U.Work`, `U.EvaluatingAndRefreshing`. This list is **illustrative**, not exhaustive—the graph **does not depend** on this particular set.\n* **Edges `E`:** a **single edge kind `U.Transfer`** (typed) carrying artifacts/tokens; all **plane/Context/edition** changes occur **only at nodes via `OperationalGate(profile)`** with **Bridge + CL** annotations; penalties **→ R only**. Transport conversions pin **Φ‑policies** and editions.\n* **Scopes:** `Γ_time` (budgets, horizons), `PublicationScope` for faces (E.17), and **slice ids** for refresh (G.11).\n\n **CtxState (PS‑projection; closed slots):** `CtxState = ⟨L, P, E⃗, D⟩` is the **projection of E.17 Publication Scope**.\n **Slot definitions (normative):**\n  • `L := Locus` — an element of a partially ordered **ContextSlice** poset; addresses *where* claims apply (disciplinary / organizational / holonic slice).\n  • `P := ReferencePlane` — the reference plane/units registry id; **no plane/unit declarations or translations** occur in CV; crossings remain gated (A.21).\n  • `E⃗ := Edition vector` — a **partial map** `edition_key ↦ EditionId` over named families `{CG‑Spec, ComparatorSet, UNM.TransportRegistryΦ}` and optional `{DescriptorMapRef, DistanceDefRef, CharacteristicSpaceRef}` when cited.\n  • `D := DesignRunTag` — `design(T^D)` or `run(T^R)`, used by **LaunchGate** and acceptance/telemetry duties.\n **Invariants.** Raw `U.Transfer` preserves `CtxState` (`⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`): it does **not** write/update any CtxState slot; any CtxState write/update (or entry to `U.WorkEnactment`) occurs at `OperationalGate(profile)`.\n **Extension discipline.** Any extra slot beyond ⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩ **SHALL** be registered in the **E.17/LEX “CtxState Extension Registry”** with slot‑id, intent, partial‑order law (neutral/absorbing), and SquareLaw compatibility; unregistered extensions are non‑conformant.\n **Data‑shape location.** Concrete record shapes for `PathId/PathSliceId`, Γ‑pins, and lineage remain in A.22 `FlowSpec`; E.TGA fixes that **flow = valuation** and that `CtxState` is preserved across raw transfers.\n\n * **Kinds:** `U.Transduction(kind∈{Signature, Mechanism, Work, Check, StructuralReinterpretation})`.  \n  **Exact identification (no TGA‑local taxonomy):**  \n  — `Signature` **≡** **A.6.0** `U.Signature` (universal, law‑governed declaration).  \n  — `Mechanism` **≡** **A.6.1** `U.Mechanism` (law‑governed application over a SubjectKind/BaseType).  \n  — `Work` **≡** **A.15** `U.WorkEnactment` (world‑contact; `FinalizeLaunchValues` only here).  \n  — `Check` **≡** `OperationalGate(profile)` (universal **gate**; A.* patternisation pending; CC‑TGA catalog applies).  \n  — `StructuralReinterpretation` **≡** a species of **A.6.4** `U.EpistemicRetargeting` used as a graph node in E.TGA. **All retargeting semantics** (slot‑level discipline, `DescribedEntitySlot`/`GroundingHolonSlot` behaviour, invariants, Bridges, witnesses) come from **C.2.1** and **A.6.2–A.6.5**; E.TGA does **not** introduce a TGA‑local variant of retargeting.  \n  `OperationalGate ≔ U.Transduction(kind=Check)` with DecisionLog aggregation.  \n  The only extra discipline E.TGA adds for `StructuralReinterpretation` is **graph‑local**: CtxState and GateCrossing behaviour are governed by **CC‑TGA‑06‑EX** and **CC‑TGA‑11** (projection‑preserving w.r.t. `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`, PathSlice‑local, and “no plane/unit change without a gate”). \n\n> **MVPK integration (import).** Every vertex with an external surface is published via **MVPK** faces (`PlainView`, `TechCard`, `AssuranceLane`, `InteropCard`) under a declared **PublicationScope** (E.17). E.TGA **reuses** MVPK’s publication laws (pins, lawful‑order discipline, “no new numeric claims / no I/O re‑listing”) and only adds graph‑level constraints in S3 and **CC‑TGA‑09/10**; it does **not** define a second, local publication semantics. \n\n**GateCrossing (normative)**\n**Definition.** A **GateCrossing** is the typed transition at a node that writes/updates any of:\n  (i) `U.BoundedContext` (**Context**), (ii) **ReferencePlane**, (iii) any member of the **Edition vector** `E⃗` (e.g., `CG‑Spec`, `ComparatorSet`, `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ`, `DescriptorMapRef`, `DistanceDefRef`, `CharacteristicSpaceRef`), (iv) **DesignRunTag** (`T^D↔T^R`), or (v) **Kind/describedEntity** (only under `StructuralReinterpretation` subject to **CC‑TGA‑06‑EX**).\n**Invariants.** Raw `U.Transfer` preserves `CtxState`; a GateCrossing occurs at exactly one `OperationalGate(profile)` (SquareLaw applies).\n**Required pins (minimum).** `BridgeCard + UTS row`; `CL` for scope bridges; `CL^plane` for plane crossings; `CL^k` with `bridgeChannel=Kind` for kind transitions; `PublicationScopeId`; `PathSliceId`; Γ‑pins on compare/launch faces.\n**Canonical reference.** `CrossingRef := ⟨GateId, channel, from, to, UTS.RowId, PathSliceId⟩`. Any DecisionLog entry whose rationale depends on a crossing **SHALL** cite `CrossingRef`.\n**CrossingSurface (normative)**\n**Definition.** A **CrossingSurface** is the published bundle that makes a GateCrossing **auditable and replayable** (crossing visibility). It includes:\n* the canonical **`CrossingRef`**;\n* the matching **UTS row** (**`UTS.RowId`**) for the crossing;\n* the required pins **`PublicationScopeId`** and **`PathSliceId`**;\n* where a Bridge is involved: the **BridgeCard** (F.9) and its disclosed fields (`BridgeId`, `bridgeChannel`, **CL** and loss notes; **`CL^k`** when `bridgeChannel=Kind`; **`ReferencePlane(src,tgt)`**);\n* where planes differ: **`CL^plane`** and the active **`Φ_plane`** as a **`PolicyIdRef`** (policy-id + resolvable refs; F.8:8.1);\n* the active penalty policy identifiers **`Φ(CL)`** (and **`Ψ(CL^k)`** if used) as **`PolicyIdRef`** bundles (policy-id + `PolicySpecRef` + `MintDecisionRef?`; F.8:8.1);\n* any additional pins mandated by the active **GateProfile** / GateChecks (A.21) for this crossing.\n\n**Obligation.** Every **GateCrossing MUST publish its CrossingSurface**. Missing or non‑conformant CrossingSurface is a **blocking** defect for downstream consumption (selectors, acceptance, audits).\n\n**Term separation.** **Transfer** denotes the sole edge kind `U.Transfer` (graph edges). **Transport** denotes Φ‑governed conversion **policies/registries** (**`TransportRegistry^Φ`** under UNM). Wording “reuse via Transport” refers to registries/policies, not to an additional graph edge.\n\n#### E.18:5.2 - S2 - Flows as valuations (paths + state + guards)\n* A **Flow** is a **valuation** `ν` over `U.Transfer` edges and cut‑sets, paired with an **admissible path** `p = v₀ → … → v_k`. The valuation assigns tokens/states under `CtxState` and records publication events under a declared `PublicationScopeId`. **The concrete pins and identifiers (`PathId`, `PathSliceId`, Γ_time on compare/launch faces) are specified in A.22 `FlowSpec` and A.25 `Sentinel & SubFlow`.** This reflects the “graph ≠ flow” norm (flow = valuation), with gates placed exactly on GateCrossings.  \n* **Admissible path (definition).** A path `p` is **admissible** iff:  \n  (a) node/edge types match the declared `τ_V, τ_E`;  \n  (b) any write/update to any member of `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` (or kind‑retargeting under `StructuralReinterpretation`) appears at **exactly one** `OperationalGate(profile)`;  \n  (c) each GateCrossing on `p` has a **SquareLaw witness** (CC‑TGA‑23) and, where applicable, a **SquareLaw‑retargeting witness** (CC‑TGA‑06‑EX);  \n  (d) no hidden crossings occur across raw transfers;  \n  (e) Γ‑pins are present on compare/launch faces;  \n  (f) `T^D↔T^R` occurs **only** at `LaunchGate`.\n\n* `U.Transfer` preserves `CtxState` (`⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`) and carries **Assurance‑operations** only (see S3b); any crossing of locus/plane/editions or `T^D↔T^R` is placed at `OperationalGate(profile)`.\n* A **PathSlice** is a **slice‑scoped execution window** used for refresh/telemetry; faces pin `PathSliceId`; **re‑emission** happens when any pinned edition changes or `SliceRefresh` is triggered by sentinel rules.\n\n> **Consequences.** The assignment’s “reference flow” is simply one `p` in `TransductionGraph`. Other domains (supply chain, water network, NN functional) instantiate different `p` on the **same architecture**.\n> \n**Why \"flow = valuation\" doesn't kill the \"something is flowing\" intuition**\nThere are two complementary perspectives:\n* **Lagrangian (intuitive):** \"water particles\" run through pipes; you \"track\" tokens.\n* **Eulerian (architectural):** you define a **function on edges** (\"how much/what passes through each edge under a given regime\"), with gate laws. E.TGA deliberately fixes the **Eulerian semantics of flow** at the architectural level: \"flow (= valuation) + publication log\", while the dynamics of \"movement\" show up as **re-valuation** over a **PathSlice** (the execution/republishing window) under gate rules and the SquareLaw. This yields comparability, reproducibility, and slice-local refresh.\n\n#### E.18:5.3 - S3 - Publication discipline (faces)\n\nE.TGA **imports E.17** wholesale **and associates MVPK faces with `PublicationScope` (USM)**.  \n**MVPK remains the normative source** for:\n* the set of face kinds (`PlainView`, `TechCard`, `InteropCard`, `AssuranceLane`),\n* pin discipline and Publication Characteristics (PC),\n* “no new numeric claims / no I/O re‑listing / no Γ‑semantics on faces”.\n\nE.TGA **does not re‑specify** these laws; it only adds **graph‑level obligations** for faces emitted over transduction paths:\n\n1. **Crossings on faces.** When a face participates in a GateCrossing (S1.b/S9), it **SHALL** cite `BridgeId + UTS row + CL` and publish **Φ(CL)/Φ_plane RuleId**; **penalties remain in R‑lane**.\n2. **Gate‑requirement on cited editions.** Any face that references editions of `CG‑Spec` / `ComparatorSet` / `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ` includes **`BridgeCard + UTS row`**; faces without this are treated as **non‑consumable downstream**.  (delegated tests → A.27/A.34)  \n3. **ComparatorSet & set returns (graph‑scope).** Any `ComparatorSet` and `SetSemanticsRef` used along a transduction path **SHALL** carry **edition identifiers**; flows **re‑emit** faces on edition change; faces with comparison **return sets / lawful partial orders** (no hidden scalarization), reusing MVPK’s lawful‑order discipline.\n4. **Γ_time on compare/launch faces.** All compare/launch faces on E.TGA paths pin `Γ_time`; implicit *latest* is illegal. The **shape and evaluation** of `Γ_time` live in A.26; E.TGA only mandates presence. **CHR avoids acceptance thresholds** (*NoThresholdsInCHR*); thresholding and launches surface in G‑patterns and `U.Work`.  (delegated tests → A.32/A.33). **Unknowns remain tri‑state (`pass|degrade|abstain`) and fold per GateProfile (A.21/A.26).**  \n\n> **Reminder.** MVPK already bans “signature” on faces, I/O re‑listing, arithmetic on faces, and unpinned numeric content (E.17 §5.4–5.5). E.TGA **does not weaken or override** those rules; it only constrains how they are used along transduction paths.\n\n**Lean publish‑mode (AssuranceLane‑Lite).** Lean affects **faces only** (`PlainView`/`AssuranceLane` minimal), not checks; publication shows `GateProfile`, `GateCheckRef[]`, and `DecisionLogRef`; the underlying GateChecks list remains unchanged.\n\n**Decision stability & idempotency (delegated).** Gate decisions are **idempotent** under a congruence relation over inputs; the **witness and equivalence criteria** are specified in **A.41 DecisionLog**. E.TGA **does not** prescribe storage formats, key shapes, or hashing schemes.\n\n**KindBridge admissibility (publication).**  \nTreat a step as a **describedEntity/kind** transition (including `StructuralReinterpretation` under CC‑TGA‑06‑EX) **iff** the **UTS row**:\n  — satisfies the **minimal Bridge row** obligations of A.27 (identity, `ReferencePlane`, `CL/CL^plane`, edition‑pins for `CG‑Spec` / `ComparatorSet` / `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ`, `ComparatorSetRef`, `BridgeId`, `Φ‑RuleIds`), and  \n  — is additionally marked as a **KindBridge** per C.3 (`bridgeChannel=Kind`, `CL^k`, mapping or signature‑translation, order‑preservation claims, loss notes, definedness area, determinism).  \nOtherwise this KindBridge explanation does not apply (the step falls back to a gated crossing). When the gate owns the crossing, `CrossingRef` is surfaced and linked from the `DecisionLog`.\n\n#### E.18:5.4 - S4 - Assurance‑operations on `U.Transfer` (counterfactual admissibility)\nOn `U.Transfer` edges, an operation is interpreted as a **declarative assurance‑operation** **iff** it is one of  \n`ConstrainTo(rule)` - `CalibrateTo(map|standard)` - `CiteEvidence(anchor)` - `AttributeTo(agent|role)`; otherwise this explanation does not apply.\nUnder this interpretation, `CtxState⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` is preserved.  \nIf an effect entails a plane/unit change, the assurance‑operations explanation does not apply and the step is handled as a gated crossing (`OperationalGate(profile)+Bridge+UTS`).  \nIf Φ assigns penalties, they appear in the R‑lane; otherwise no penalties are surfaced here.\n\n#### E.18:6.5 - S5 - Comparability & aggregation (normalize‑then‑compare; counterfactual form)\n\nThe comparison explanation applies under the following admissibility conditions:\n\n* If a path segment intends to compare/aggregate, it is admissible as a comparison **only when** UNM precedes it; UNM is **method‑independent**, publishes **TransportRegistry^Φ** and **CG‑Spec** anchors, and faces cite those editions; otherwise this comparison explanation does not apply.\n* If the comparator defines a **lawful partial order**, then returns are **sets/archives** (Pareto/Archive); if a **total order** is declared, it is the one provided by the comparator; otherwise set semantics apply and covert scalarization is out of scope here.\n* If a claim is **ordinal‑only**, then only comparisons are surfaced; arithmetic transforms (e.g., means/z‑scores) are out of scope of this explanation and belong to declared comparators or downstream policy.\n\n**Edition‑aware artifacts (e.g., QD archives) MUST pin `DescriptorMapRef.edition` / `DistanceDefRef.edition` (and `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition` when applicable); refresh is slice‑local.**  (delegated tests → A.34/A.37)  \n\n#### E.18:5.6 - S6 - Cycle discipline (Selection ↔ Planning)\n\n* The architecture centers the loop between `U.SelectionAndTuning` and `U.WorkPlanning`.\n* The loop operates under a local **budget / max_iter** in `Γ_time`; at expiry, the selector emits the **current `CandidateSet`** and **`MethodTuning`** with a **partial‑optimality** flag; further improvement rolls into the **next `PathSlice`**.\n* **UNM occurs before the loop**; if measurements are missing/stale, UNM emits a **FreshnessRequest** which is **planned** in `U.WorkPlanning` and **executed** in `U.Work`. Transfers, units, and calibrations are surfaced publication‑wise as `CalibrateTo(map|standard)` and pinned to `TransportRegistry^Φ` (**R‑channel only** for penalties).\n* **WorkEnactment is the only site for launch‑value slot filling** (`FinalizeLaunchValues / FinalizeLaunchValuesOnlyInWork`). \n> **Refresh orchestration.** Telemetry from `U.WorkEnactment` and publications are **slice‑scoped**, editions re‑pinned, faces **re‑emitted**. \n\n#### E.18:5.7 - S7 - Selector semantics (G.5) & parity harness (G.9)\n\n* **Selectors return sets.** Default **DominanceRegime** is `ParetoOnly`; **IlluminationSummary** (telemetry summary) and any coverage/regret (telemetry metrics) are **report‑only telemetry** (reported), excluded from dominance **unless** a CAL policy promotes them (policy‑id in SCR).\n\nIf `PortfolioMode=Archive`, a **QD archive** may be returned; when generation is in scope, pairs `{environment, method}` are managed under declared **EnvironmentValidityRegion** and **TransferRulesRef**; parity artefacts and `PathSliceId` are pinned on publication. Details of comparator semantics and archive pinning live in **A.28/A.34**.\n\n#### E.18:5.8 - S8 - Guard ownership and handling (USM §1.2)\n* **USM.CompareGuard**/**USM.LaunchGuard** **publish `GuardOwnerGateId`**. Guard failures are **events** aggregated by the owner gate (not GateChecks).\n* **Ownership rules:** (i) `USM.LaunchGuard.owner = LaunchGateId(U.WorkEnactment)`; (ii) inside a Subflow, `USM.CompareGuard.owner = OperationalGate(InSentinel)`; Join‑nodes cannot own guard pins.\n\n**GateProfile data shape (cross‑reference).** The **entire data shape** (SoD/quorum, declassify, budgets, TOCTOU/freshness windows, editions vector, scopes) is **specified in A.26**. E.TGA **only names** the structure and defers its fields to A.26.\n\n**Bridge‑aware guards (cross‑reference).** USM guards apply bridge‑translation semantics (`translate(Bridge, Scope)`) with CL penalties in R‑lane; the conceptual macro is defined in **A.24 USM.Guards**.\n\n**Error/timeout/unknown (profile‑bound).** GateCheck errors/timeouts fold to **`degrade`** under `Lean|Core` and to **`block`** under `SafetyCritical|RegulatedX`; `unknown` follows the GateCheck’s intensional rule (safety‑default: `degrade`). **The DecisionLog shape and the idempotency witness are defined in A.41; E.TGA does not define storage or key structures.**  \n\n#### E.18:5.9 - S9 - Transport & crossings\n* Cross‑Context or cross‑plane edges appear as **GateCrossings** that include a **Bridge** with **CL** policy; **Φ(CL)/Φ_plane** are published; penalties route **to R only**; **Scope membership** (USM) is unchanged by crossings. **SquareLaw is checked within a single `DesignRunTag`; a `T^D↔T^R` change is modelled as a pair of coordinated gates with `DesignRunTagFrom/To` and an external enactor (see A.29).** \n* When *describedEntity/kind* changes across a boundary, declare an explicit **KindBridge (`CL^k`)** in addition to plane/context CL; cross‑context reuse of UNM **must** go via `Transport`, with any `CL^plane` penalties routed to **R‑lane** only.\n\n#### E.18:5.10 - S10 - Non‑mechanism boundary\n\n* Publication is a **typed projection**, not execution. Any build/render/upload is **Work on carriers**; **no Γ‑semantics** may leak into faces. \n\n#### E.18:5.11 - S11 - Coordination thread (optional)\nIntroduce **CoordinationFlow** as a named thread laid over `U.TransductionFlow__P2W`; crossings with production flow go via **Bridge+UTS**; coordination publishes **LexicalView** labels only and adds **no checks** or mechanisms.\n\n#### E.18:5.12 - S12 - Viewpoint families → E.TGA constructs (neutral, holonic)\n\nE.TGA does not mint new viewpoint or view kinds. It **imports** the generic multi‑view machinery of E.17.0 `U.MultiViewDescribing`, bundles from E.17.1, and the TEVB engineering bundle from E.17.2. S12 only describes how these existing `U.Viewpoint` / `U.ViewpointBundle` ids are *used* in transduction graphs and in `UTS.ViewpointMap`; intent/concern semantics live in E.17.0–E.17.2.\n\n**Two‑layer use of TEVB and MVPK (ISO 42010 summary, no local re‑definition).**\n\n* **Engineering viewpoints.** For engineering holons, E.TGA assumes a TEVB bundle with `ViewFamilyId = VF.TEVB.ENG`. `EngineeringVPId` is one of `{VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}`, and TEVB is the normative source for their semantics. E.TGA does not refine these viewpoints.  \n* **Publication viewpoints.** Publication viewpoints come from MVPK (E.17); `PublicationVPId` is a `MVPK.ViewpointId` that governs faces under a `PublicationScope`.  \n* **Architecture description.** Under ISO 42010, an architecture description for a holon is: (i) an E.TGA transduction graph over that holon, plus (ii) MVPK faces emitted for its morphisms, with correspondences per E.17.0 linking each face to the engineering view(s) it implements. Crossings and penalties follow E.TGA’s gating rules (S9; CC‑TGA‑11/23) but do not change viewpoint semantics.  \n* **Separation of roles.** `VP.*` from TEVB are **EngineeringVPId** values only; they are not surfaces. `PublicationVPId` values live in MVPK. The mapping between them is entirely via ISO‑style correspondences and the `UTS.ViewpointMap`; E.TGA does not define a second notion of viewpoint.\n\n**Entities‑of‑interest (summary).**\n\n* **EoI‑ENG.** The engineering entity described by TEVB/E.TGA is a holon (`U.System` or `U.Episteme`) per TEVB’s `EoIClassSpec`. E.TGA does not broaden or narrow this set.  \n* **EoI‑PUB.** MVPK may treat the *architecture description* itself as an entity‑of‑interest; publication viewpoints for that AD are defined in MVPK, not here. E.TGA only requires that such faces honour MVPK discipline and E.TGA’s crossing rules.\n\n**Naming rules (aligned with E.17.0/E.17.1/E.17.2).**  \n* `ViewFamilyId` is the `U.ViewpointBundle.viewFamilyId` (e.g. `VF.TEVB.ENG` for TEVB); its lexical and ontological discipline is governed by E.17.1.  \n* `EngineeringVPId : ViewpointId` is always a `U.ViewpointId` drawn from some bundle (for TEVB, one of `{VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}`). E.TGA never defines new `VP.*` ids.  \n* `PublicationVPId : ViewpointId` is a `MVPK.ViewpointId` defined in E.17; TEVB viewpoints are **never** reused as publication viewpoints (per TEVB guard and MVPK).  \n* The legacy unqualified column name `ViewpointId` MUST NOT be used. Where it exists, it is interpreted as `PublicationVPId` and is DEPRECATED (sunset when E.23 is published).\n\n**Terminology guards (no local semantics).**\n* Within S12, “viewpoint”, “view” and “correspondence” have exactly the meanings given in E.17.0; “publication surface” means an MVPK face (`PlainView`, `TechCard`, `InteropCard`, `AssuranceLane`) under some `PublicationVPId`.  \n* Faces are **carriers for views**: a face is part of a view only when linked via an ISO‑style `CorrespondenceRef` to an engineering `U.View` under some `EngineeringVPId`; S12 does not add extra conditions beyond E.17.0/E.17.2.  \n* Labels such as “Functional view”, “Procedural view”, “Role‑Enactor view”, “Module‑Interface view” in this section are lexical aliases for TEVB viewpoints; they MUST NOT be interpreted as extra viewpoint kinds or as surface types.\n\n**Purpose.** Provide a neutral (F.18) mapping from TEVB engineering *viewpoint families* — bundle `VF.TEVB.ENG` with `VP.Functional / VP.Procedural / VP.RoleEnactor / VP.ModuleInterface` — to E.TGA constructs so that the same holon can be described functionally, procedurally, structurally, or as a module‑and‑interface architecture **without changing the underlying graph**. S12 does not introduce new `U.Viewpoint` or `U.View` kinds; it reuses those defined in E.17.0/E.17.2.\n\n**Holon target.** The mapping applies to any holon, with the constraint that only `U.System` enacts `U.Work` (A.3/A.15). Supervisory and structural hierarchies remain distinct (B.2.5).\n\n**Viewpoint family → primary E.TGA constructs (TEVB‑aligned)**  \n*All four families referenced below are TEVB engineering viewpoints; the “what …” clauses are interpretive glosses for how they *use* E.TGA constructs. Formal intent/concerns/allowed episteme kinds remain in TEVB (E.17.2).*\n1) **Function‑Oriented View (`EngineeringVPId = VP.Functional`, capability‑flow)** — “what transformation is achieved under roles”\n    * **Flow substrate:** `U.TransductionFlow__P2W` through nodes `SubstrateFormalization → OntologyAuthoring → CHRAuthoring → PrincipleFraming → MechanismRealization → UNM.Usage (ContextNormalization) → SelectionAndTuning ↔ WorkPlanning → WorkEnactment → EvaluatingAndRefreshing`.\n    * **Publication:** MVPK publication surfaces per E.17; comparable claims pin to `CG‑Spec/ComparatorSet` editions; crossings surface via `Bridge+UTS` and `CL/CL^plane` (penalties → **R‑lane** only). \n    * **Checks:** A.20 (CV) inside transformations; A.21 (GateFit) at gates; enforce CSLC/No‑Hidden‑Scalarization per A.28. \n    *  **Holonic note:** `U.Episteme` does not *act*; it is used by systems acting on carriers; `U.Work` appears only for `U.System`. \n2) **Procedure‑Oriented View (`EngineeringVPId = VP.Procedural`, step/time storyboard)** — “what steps occur and when”\n    * **Artifacts:** `U.WorkPlan` (A.15.2) for intent/schedule; `U.WorkEnactment` for enactment.\n    * **Boundary:** entry into `U.WorkEnactment` is via `OperationalGate(profile)` with `USM.LaunchGuard`; `DesignRunTag` separates design time from run time; `DesignRunTagFrom/To` appear only at gates. \n    * **Holonic note:** Applies to any `U.System` scope (single holon or a supervised sub‑holon cluster); supervisory layering is handled by roles rather than structural mereology (B.2.5).\n3) **Role‑Enactor / Device‑Structure View (`EngineeringVPId = VP.RoleEnactor`)** — “what carrier/ports/constraints exist; who typically enacts it”\n    * **Artifacts:** Module *interfaces* are `Signature` nodes; module realizations are `MechanismRealization` nodes; inter‑module dependencies traverse `U.Transfer`, with gates on crossings. \n    * **Publication:** MVPK faces are **typed projections**, not executable artifacts; faces add **no new numeric claims** (E.17). Constraints and compatibility appear as CV checks (A.20). \n    * **Holonic note:** Structural mereology (part/whole of the carrier) is modeled in Part A; E.TGA ties interface/exposure semantics to morphisms and gates.\n    * **Device‑View reading (Transduction↔Transductor).** The same capability‑flow MAY be read as a **device** that performs the transduction (**transductor**) without changing the graph: model with `Signature` + `Mechanism` only; do **not** introduce extra edge kinds. If describedEntity retargets (function↔element), use `StructuralReinterpretation` with a **`KindBridge (CL^k)`** on **UTS** and a **SquareLaw‑Retargeting witness**; preserve `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` and treat it as a non‑crossing (**CC‑TGA‑06‑EX**; witness shape §4.7).  \n    * **Role‑label guard.** `TypicalEnactorRoleName` is **pedagogical only** and MUST NOT be used as a GateFit role; GateFit uses `U.Role` (A.21).\n4) **Module‑Interface View (`EngineeringVPId = VP.ModuleInterface`, physical/logical architecture)** — “what modules exist and how they contract across interfaces”\n    * **Artifacts:** Module *interfaces* are `Signature` nodes; module realizations are `Mechanism` nodes; inter‑module dependencies traverse `U.Transfer`, with gates on crossings. \n    * **describedEntity note:** Functional↔element reinterpretation follows the **Device‑View reading** rule above (Role‑Enactor family) and **CC‑TGA‑06‑EX**; see **§4.7** for the retargeting witness shape and CV witness linkage.\n    * **Holonic note:** The same module may appear as a holon in multiple views; supervisory loops (B.2.5) remain orthogonal to structural composition.\nThis is an expandable list of viewpoint families; TGA is intentionally viewpoint‑neutral. Additional engineering bundles beyond TEVB (safety, mission, information, …) are introduced as separate `U.ViewpointBundle` species via E.17.1/E.17.2; S12 does not define them.\n\n**Alias families for transduction species (LEX‑only).**\n*Scope.* Authors MAY declare `AliasesInViewFamilies[]` for `U.Transduction` species so readers can recognise familiar engineering view families. All semantics come from the referenced bundles (typically TEVB) and MVPK; aliases are purely lexical.\n\n*Norms.*\n1. Each `U.Transduction` species MAY publish `AliasesInViewFamilies[]` — an open list of records  \n   `{ ViewFamilyId, EngineeringVPId?, Alias : TechASCII }`.  \n   * If `ViewFamilyId = VF.TEVB.ENG`, then `EngineeringVPId` MUST be one of `{VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}` (TEVB; CC‑TEVB‑1/6).  \n   * Other `ViewFamilyId` values MUST denote `U.ViewpointBundle` instances defined elsewhere (e.g. safety/assurance/information bundles), not ad‑hoc local families.\n2. Aliases are LEX‑only: **no arithmetic, no new claims, no check participation, no `CtxState` slot writes/updates (incl. `DesignRunTag`)**. They do not create MVPK faces.  \n3. Aliases MUST NOT be used as `PublicationVPId`; publication viewpoints remain in MVPK.  \n4. Twin registers are allowed (Tech/Plain) per E.10; naming follows F.18 local‑first discipline.  \n5. Do not name transductions by operands/effects (operation ≠ operand).  \n6. `TypicalEnactorRoleName` MAY be added for pedagogy; it SHALL NOT be used as a GateFit role (GateFit uses `U.Role` only).  \n7. Morphology: ASCII TitleCase; conjunctions via `And`; for composite actions use `XingAndYing` (or `XAndYing` if grammar requires).  \n8. The P2W reference species table (SubstrateFormalization … EvaluatingAndRefreshing with functional/procedural aliases and `TypicalEnactorRoleName`) is **informative** and does not change kind or viewpoint semantics.\n\n**Deliverable — `UTS.ViewpointMap` (normative, TEVB‑aligned).**  \nPublish a UTS block named `ViewpointMap` that ties engineering viewpoints (from bundles such as TEVB) to E.TGA constructs and MVPK faces.\n\n*Minimum row schema (per row).*\n* `ViewFamilyId` — `U.ViewpointBundle.viewFamilyId` (e.g. `VF.TEVB.ENG` for TEVB, or another bundle id).  \n* `EngineeringVPId : ViewpointId` — a viewpoint from that bundle (for TEVB, one of `{VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}`).  \n* `PublicationVPId : ViewpointId?` — MVPK publication viewpoint id that governs faces implementing this engineering view (optional if not publishing).  \n* `TargetHolon ∈ {U.System, U.Episteme}` *(extended species may add `{U.ServiceClause|U.MethodFamily}`; if `TargetHolon ≠ U.System`, no `U.Work` enactment appears).*  \n* `PrimaryTGAConstructs` — nodes/edges/gates actually used for this `(ViewFamilyId, EngineeringVPId, TargetHolon)` (typically one of the four families above).  \n* `Crossings{BridgeId, CL/CL^plane?}` — crossings involved; penalties route to R‑lane only.  \n* `EditionPins{…}` whenever comparable claims appear (bind to CG‑Spec/ComparatorSet editions; any face citing editions includes `BridgeCard + UTS` row per MVPK/UNM).  \n* `SenseCells[]` (≥ 2 per row), each citing Context name + edition (F.17/E.10 discipline; UTS‑wide coverage rules still apply).  \n* *(REQUIRED when publishing)* `CorrespondenceRef[]` — ISO 42010 correspondences linking emitted faces to the engineering view(s) they implement; may cross architecture descriptions.  \n* *(RECOMMENDED)* `ConcernsCovered[]` — ISO 42010 stakeholder concerns addressed by this row via GateProfiles/check catalogues.\n\n**Conformance (S12‑scoped).**  \n(i) `UTS.ViewpointMap` exists.  \n(ii) For each holon that claims TEVB alignment, there are ≥ 4 rows whose `{ViewFamilyId, EngineeringVPId}` cover `{VF.TEVB.ENG × {VP.Functional, VP.Procedural, VP.RoleEnactor, VP.ModuleInterface}}` (per CC‑TEVB‑1/6).  \n(iii) Rows that surface editions also include `BridgeCard + UTS` rows per A.27; edition‑bearing faces that lack such rows MUST NOT be used for downstream consumption.  \n(iv) Each row has ≥ 2 `SenseCells` and the sheet meets global UTS coverage rules.  \n(v) Any `TargetHolon = U.System` that reaches `U.Work` shows `LaunchGate` with `DesignRunTag` consistency.  \n(vi) Crossings referenced in `ViewpointMap` follow CC‑TGA‑11; comparability along the mapped paths follows CC‑TGA‑10.  \n(vii) Rows MUST NOT use an unqualified `ViewpointId`; they MUST use `EngineeringVPId` and/or `PublicationVPId` explicitly.  \n(viii) When faces are published, `CorrespondenceRef[]` MUST be present and resolvable to `U.Viewpoint` ids.  \n(ix) Additional bundles (e.g. assurance, information, mission) MAY appear as extra `ViewFamilyId` values but MUST be declared as `U.ViewpointBundle` species; they do not extend `VF.TEVB.ENG`.\n",

Adding a **new kind** requires an explicit E.TGA update. `StructuralReinterpretation` nodes are **projection‑preserving** (no mutation of `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`) and carry CV/GF obligations per A.20/A.21/A.45. **Mapping to A.\\*** (normative): the enumeration is **not** a TGA‑local taxonomy; each `kind` is identified 1‑to‑1 with its A.\\* anchor: `Signature→A.6.0`, `Mechanism→A.6.1`, `Work→A.15`, `Check→OperationalGate` (until a dedicated A.\\* pattern is published). **Disambiguation:** `Signature (kind)` ≠ `KindSignature` (C.3.2) and ≠ `A.6.A Architheory Signature` view. | Type registry shows at least the listed kinds; additional species map to one of them; checks realized as `OperationalGate` (see CC‑TGA‑06‑EX/11). **Lint:** registry/table exposes `{species → {kind, KindDefinition}}`; missing or mismatched `KindDefinition` fails. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑03 — Identity, composition, functorial faces** | Identities exist; path composition associative; publication is functorial: `Emit_s(t₂∘t₁)=Emit_s(t₂)∘Emit_s(t₁)`. | Pick two‑step path; MVPK faces commute (Square witness). |\n| **CC‑TGA‑04 — Graph spec** | Spec declares `τ_V, τ_E`, `Γ_time`, Transport/Bridge registries. | Spec file shows typed registries and Γ policy. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑05 — CtxState pins** | `CtxState=⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` is pinned on ports/tokens; raw `U.Transfer` does **not** write/update it. | Along a raw transfer, ⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩ is preserved. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑06 — Operational gates only** | Any write/update to any member of ⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩ or entry into `U.WorkEnactment` is mediated by `OperationalGate(profile)` with aggregated `DecisionLog`. | Diff CtxState across edges; if any member differs, exactly one gate exists with DecisionLog. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑06‑EX (strictly limited) — Projection retargeting without gate** | A node of kind **`StructuralReinterpretation`** MAY retarget the **published projection** without invoking `OperationalGate` **only if all hold**: **(a)** `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` is preserved; **(b)** any **describedEntity** change has a **KindBridge** (`CL^k`) entry on MVPK/**UTS**; **(c)** a **SquareLaw‑retargeting witness** is present (on UTS); **(d)** the operation is **PathSlice‑local** (`PathSliceId` pinned); **(e)** **no plane/unit change** occurs (plane/unit changes remain gated); **(f)** **CV.ReinterpretationEquivalence** (A.20) is `pass`; **(g)** **NoHiddenScalarization** — if the step concerns a comparable return shape, set/partial‑order semantics are preserved and comparators remain ref‑only (cf. A.28). | UTS row includes `bridgeChannel=Kind` and `CL^k`; SquareLaw‑retargeting witness present; PathSliceId pinned; CV status recorded; no scalarization detected. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑07 — CV⇒GF activation predicate** | Until **aggregated `ConstraintValidity` = `pass`**, all **GateFit** checks return `abstain`. | Simulate CV failure ⇒ GateFit `abstain`. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑08 — LaunchGate discipline (incl. pre‑run barrier)** | Each `U.WorkEnactment` has exactly one `LaunchGate` owning `USM.LaunchGuard`; **mandatory** checks: `FreshnessUpToDate`, `DesignRunTagConsistency`. If preceding step’s CV ≠ `pass`, LaunchGate decision is `block` (cause logged). | Owner resolution `GuardOwnerGateId = LaunchGateId(U.WorkEnactment)`; CV≠pass ⇒ `block` with log. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑09 — MVPK publication discipline** | Every surfaced node uses MVPK; faces carry `PublicationScopeId`, presence‑pins, **edition ids**, Γ pins; **no I/O duplication** or arithmetic; faces add no new numeric claims. | Cards show `PublicationScopeId`; pins present; no “signature”/math on faces. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑10 — Normalize→Compare (CSLC)** | Any comparison cites **UNM/CG‑Spec** editions and **ComparatorSetRef**; ordinal claims are compare‑only; partial orders return sets; edition‑aware artifacts (QD/archives) pin `{DescriptorMapRef, DistanceDefRef, CharacteristicSpaceRef?}.edition`; **any face citing editions includes `BridgeCard + UTS row`**. **NoHiddenScalarization — detection criteria:** (1) return shape is **set/poset**, not scalar; (2) `ComparatorSetRef` is present and edition‑pinned; (3) MVPK faces add **no new numeric claims**; (4) any summarisation is **order‑preserving & set‑valued**; otherwise conformance fails. | Faces show comparator pins; archive pins present; linter rejects edition cites without UTS; scalarisation checks pass.\n| **CC‑TGA‑11 — Crossings gated** | Cross‑Context/plane crossings publish **BridgeId + UTS + CL/CL^plane** and are mediated by `OperationalGate(profile)`; **Φ/Φ_plane penalties → R‑lane only**; describedEntity change publishes **KindBridge (CL^k)**. **Exception (StructuralReinterpretation):** a **projection‑only** describedEntity retargeting is surfaced **without** a gate **iff** **CC‑TGA‑06‑EX** holds; then the UTS row includes `bridgeChannel=Kind`, `CL^k`, and a **retargeting witness**; any plane/unit change falls back to a gated crossing; `PathSliceId` is pinned; UNM reuse cross‑context continues via `Transport`. | Crossing surfaces show Bridge/UTS/CL pins; penalties routing audited. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑12 — Set‑returning selection** | `U.SelectionAndTuning` returns sets/archives under declared comparators (`ParetoOnly` by default) — no covert scalarization. | Selector output is a set/archive; policy id present if escalated. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑13 — Budgeted Selection↔Planning loop** | The loop declares **budget / max_iter**; on expiry selector publishes partial‑optimal set + `MethodTuning`; next **PathSlice** scheduled. | Logs show budget stop and slice rollover. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑14 — UNM before loop & Freshness lifecycle** | UNM runs before selection; stale/missing inputs produce **FreshnessTicket/FreshnessRequest** planned in `WorkPlanning` and executed in `WorkEnactment`; calibrations appear as `CalibrateTo(map|standard)` with Φ pins. | Ticket state machine Issued→Planned→Executed→Closed; calibrations pinned. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑15 — FinalizeLaunchValues only in WorkEnactment** | Only `U.WorkEnactment` performs `FinalizeLaunchValues` and fills launch‑value slots. | Any earlier attempt blocks at LaunchGate; a `FinalizeLaunchValues` witness is present in Work. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑16 — Guard ownership & semantics** | `USM.CompareGuard`/`USM.LaunchGuard` publish owner gate; guards are **events**, not GateChecks; failures are aggregated by owner’s gate per profile. | Guard pins show owner; GuardFail routed to owner’s DecisionLog. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑17 — Assurance ops on Transfer** | On `U.Transfer` only `ConstrainTo/CalibrateTo/CiteEvidence/AttributeTo`; none write/update `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`. | Edge audit shows ops; CtxState unchanged across the edge. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑17a — Assurance ops contracts (normative)** | **ConstrainTo(region|policy)**: tightens declared region/policy; **pre**: region⊆current; **post**: `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` unchanged; **idem.** and **monotone** under composition. **CalibrateTo(map|standard)**: attaches **editioned** calibration map/standard with Φ‑policy id; lawful per CG‑Spec; **post**: `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` unchanged; **idem.** on same edition; penalties **→ R only**. **CiteEvidence(anchor)**: binds carriers via **SCR/RSCR**; adds no numeric claims; **idem.**; missing carriers ⇒ **abstain**. **AttributeTo(role|source)**: provenance only; decision algebra unaffected; **idem.** Hidden GateChecks, plane/unit changes, or edition writes on edges are **forbidden**. | Contracts visible on edge audit; violations fail lint. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑18 — Flow = valuation & slice‑local refresh** | A flow declares valuation `ν` over `U.Transfer` plus `PublicationScopeId` and `PathSliceId`; **sentinel‑bounded** refresh; re‑emit on edition change or sentinel rule. | FlowSpec shows ν; sentinel bump triggers slice‑local recompute. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑19 — Γ_time on compare/launch** | All compare/launch faces pin `Γ_time`; no implicit *latest*. | Face audit shows Γ pins; LaunchGate blocks on stale. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑19a — Γ_time pin shape (normative)** | The `Γ_time` pin is one of: `snapshot(t)`, `interval[t1,t2]` (closed), or `policy(Γ_timeRuleId)` that resolves to either; CV computations record the **resolved time basis** in `DecisionLog` and do not widen Γ at publication time. | DecisionLog shows basis; linter rejects missing/implicit Γ. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑20 — Lean publish‑mode ≠ weaken** | `AssuranceLane‑Lite` affects faces only; required GateChecks for the active profile remain intact. | Gate in Lean/Core shows minimal pins; GateChecks list unchanged. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑21 — Decision stability & idempotency witness** | Gate decisions are stable under the equivalence relation defined in **A.41**; a **witness of equivalence** is present on the DecisionLog surface; any change that breaks equivalence requires re‑aggregation. **Minimum lexeme (CV‑relevant surfaces):** `EquivalenceWitness := { keys, E⃗, Γ_time(basis), PathSliceId?, ReturnShapeClass, ComparatorSetRef?, profile }`. | Modify any input outside the declared equivalence ⇒ re‑aggregation; DecisionLog records the witness (A.41); lexeme present.\n| **CC‑TGA‑21a — Decision join (publication algebra)** | Aggregation over GateChecks is the **idempotent, commutative, associative join** on the lattice `abstain ≤ pass ≤ degrade ≤ block` with **neutral = `abstain`** and **absorbing = `block`**. The algebra is conceptual; publications surface only (i) the aggregated **GateDecision** and (ii) its **GateDecisionRationale** recorded in the **DecisionLog**. A **GateDecisionExplanation** is an optional human‑readable narrative derived from the GateDecisionRationale; it is **not** a decision and MUST NOT be used as one. If aggregated `ConstraintValidity ≠ pass` or the active profile suppresses narratives, any GateFit‑oriented GateDecisionExplanation **does not apply**. | Review a gate with multiple GateChecks: the aggregated decision matches the lattice join; no per‑check arithmetic is introduced on faces. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑22 — Errors/unknowns fold by profile** | Errors/timeouts fold to `degrade` under `Lean|Core` and to `block` under `SafetyCritical|RegulatedX`; `unknown` folds per GateCheck policy (safety‑default: `degrade`). | DecisionLog shows folds; profile switch changes fold behavior accordingly. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑23 — SquareLaw on crossings** | For every GateCrossing, `gate_out ∘ transfer = transfer' ∘ gate_in`; LaunchGate case is mandatory. | MVPK shows commuting square; inconsistency yields `block|degrade` per profile. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑24 — UNM single‑writer** | `CG‑Spec`, `ComparatorSet`, `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ` editions are authored only by `UNM.Authoring` (others ref‑only). | Authorship cards: UNM is sole writer; others have refs only. |\n| **CC‑TGA‑25 — Evidence lanes & DecisionLogs** | AssuranceLane surfaces GateProfile, GateCheckRef list, edition pins, aggregated decision, `DecisionLogRef`; **evidence pins follow a two‑layer scheme**: **carriers** are pinned via **`SCR/RSCR`**, and **value annotations** are surfaced under **`VALATA (VA/LA/TA)`**. | Gate surfaces include these pins; logs retrievable. |\n\n> **Coupling note.** `CC‑TGA‑07 (CV⇒GF)` and `CC‑TGA‑21a (Decision join)` together ensure that any GateFit‑scoped GateCheckRef **returns `abstain`** until the aggregated CV status equals `pass`; CV/GF separation remains intact. \n> **Authoring note (scope of E.TGA vs A.*):** Detailed, mechanism‑level checks and most publication content are specified in the **A.* patterns** (A.20…A.42). E.TGA fixes only carcass‑level obligations above.\n\n**Glossary (additions)**  \n* *Open‑world species* — non‑exhaustive domain‑level specializations of `U.Transduction` that map to the minimal kind set.  \n* *Signature (TGA kind)* — `U.Transduction(kind=Signature)`; **identical to** **A.6.0** `U.Signature` (universal block). **Not** a `C.3.2 KindSignature`.  \n* *Architheory Signature (A.6.A)* — family‑specific **view** and discipline that **specialises** A.6.0 for architheories; the universal A.6.0 block remains the source of truth.  \n* *KindSignature (C.3.2)* — intensional definition of a `U.Kind` (intent/extent, F); **unrelated** to TGA kinds; never a `genus`.  \n* *Species (domain‑level)* — typed specialisations `speciesOf(kind=…)` that **MUST** declare `KindDefinition=A.*` id (e.g., `kind=Mechanism; KindDefinition=A.6.1`).  \n* *KindBridge (`CL^k`)* — a compatibility surface on UTS for describedEntity/kind transitions; required by CC‑TGA‑06‑EX and crossings (CC‑TGA‑11).\n* *Eulerian interpretation* — operational stance where a flow is treated as a valuation over `U.Transfer` and edges perform assurance‑only operations (no token‑passing semantics).\n* **GateCheckRef shape (publication lexeme, normative here).** Where GateChecks are surfaced, a **GateCheckRef** is a record\n  `GateCheckRef := { aspect, kind, edition, scope }` with:\n  `aspect ∈ {ConstraintValidity, GateFit}`, `kind ∈ GateCheckKind`, `edition ∈ Editions`, and `scope ∈ {lane | locus | subflow | profile}`. \n* **GateDecision / GateDecisionRationale / GateDecisionExplanation (terminology).**\n  — **GateDecision** — the aggregated lattice value produced by `OperationalGate(profile)` for a specific `{GateProfile, GateCheckRef[]}`.\n  — **GateDecisionRationale** — the minimal structured support **for that GateDecision**: per‑check outcomes, profile‑bound folds, and surfaced evidence/witness references on the DecisionLog; it records **why the GateDecision is admissible** under the active profile.\n  — **GateDecisionExplanation** — an optional human‑readable narrative derived from the GateDecisionRationale; it **does not carry decision status**. While aggregated `ConstraintValidity ≠ pass`, GateFit‑scoped checks return `abstain`; any GateFit‑oriented GateDecisionExplanation **does not apply**.\n> **Clarity note.** **GateDecision ≠ GateDecisionExplanation**; narratives are optional and derivative of GateDecisionRationale.\n\n* **GateFit (aspect, not an entity).** GateFit names the **aspect** of checks that evaluate **profile‑fit**; there is no separate GateFit entity. “Gate decision under GateFit” means “the gate’s decision computed from GateChecks with `aspect=GateFit`”.\n\n  This shape is publication‑level only; it introduces no new execution steps and no arithmetic on faces.  (Couples to A.20/A.21 without duplicating their check catalogs.)\n* *VALATA (VA/LA/TA)* — value‑annotation scheme used on **AssuranceLane**; **carriers** are referenced via **SCR/RSCR**; detailed obligations live in A.10/A.29. Included here so evidence pins are self‑describing in E‑level texts.\n* *Transfer vs Transport* — **Transfer** = the sole graph edge kind `U.Transfer`. **Transport** = Φ‑policy/registry‑defined conversions (`TransportRegistry^Φ`) referenced by UNM; “reuse via Transport” refers to the latter.\n* *GateCrossing* — a typed node transition that writes/updates a CtxState slot or the kind‑channel; see **S1.b** for the normative list and required pins.\n* *Admissible path* — a typed path obeying the GateCrossing discipline (no hidden crossings; witnesses present), Γ‑pinned on compare/launch, and `T^D↔T^R` only at `LaunchGate`; see **S2**.\n",

        "consequences": "### E.18:10 - Consequences\n\n**Benefits.**\n\n1. **Universality with discipline:** one edge kind and explicit gates eliminate “second process ladders” and make cross‑domain flows (ML, supply‑chain, TAMP/MPC, scientific workflows) uniformly analyzable and auditable.\n2. **Comparability & replayability:** CSLC and edition‑pinned comparators prevent covert scalarization and enable lawful set returns and reproducible decisions.\n3. **Locality of change:** sentinel subflows restrict refresh to affected `PathSlice`s; large graphs remain stable under frequent edition bumps.\n4. **Clean design/run fold:** LaunchGate and `DesignRunTagConsistency` stop premature launch‑value slot filling; acceptance and telemetry live where they occur (`U.Work`).\n5. **Assurance visibility:** MVPK makes GateProfile/DecisionLog surfaces locally checkable and cacheable for the same `{PathSlice, GateChecks, Editions}`.\n\n**Trade‑offs.**\na) **Higher upfront modeling cost:** explicit Bridge/UTS pins and GateProfiles demand care; mitigated by Lean profile and templates.\nb) **Longer edge surfaces:** MVPK faces are verbose by design; Lean surfaces can be used for low‑risk segments.\nc) **Tooling alignment:** some incumbent DAG‑only orchestrators conflict with budgeted cycles and set‑return semantics; adapters must project E.TGA semantics to their interop layer (never the other way round).\n",

Vendor/tool tokens are kept as *informative*, not normative.\n\n1. **Applied category theory (compositional open systems).**\n   **Adopt.** Monoidal composition and wiring justify “nodes as morphisms, edges as carriers” and functorial publication of faces; they also provide algebraic laws for joining subflows. (Fong & Spivak, *Seven Sketches in Compositionality*, 2019).\n\n2. **Operads / wiring diagrams / hypergraph categories.**\n   **Adopt/Adapt.** Typed ports and decorated cospans model interfaces and “Bridge” junctions; we adapt the operadic composition to require CL/Φ pins on every crossing (publication‑level requirement not present in the math). (Spivak, *Operads of Wiring Diagrams*, 2021; Baez & Fong, *A Compositional Framework for Passive Linear Circuits*, 2015).\n\n3. **Open‑graph/string‑diagram rewriting.**\n   **Adapt.** Rewriting systems capture subflow refactors, but E.TGA binds rewrites to edition bumps and sentinel scopes rather than global rewrites, to preserve auditability and replay. (Bonchi et al., *Graphical Linear Algebra*, 2019; Kissinger—survey lineage).\n\n4. **Publication discipline & artefact portability.**  \n**Adopt.** Edition‑pinning and immutable registries echo contemporary reproducibility practice; E⃗ stays explicit and compositional at the publication layer.\n\n5. **Reproducibility & content addressability.**  \n   **Adopt.** Edition‑pinning and immutable registries echo modern content‑addressable reproducibility (conceptual); E⃗ stays explicit and compositional at the publication layer.\n\n6. **TAMP/MPC (integrated planning and control).**\n   **Adopt/Adapt.** The budgeted Selection↔Planning loop follows contemporary TAMP practice; MPC‑style freshness/constraint checks motivate **FreshnessUpToDate** as a hard LaunchGate module and “bind‑in‑Work‑only”. (Garrett, Lozano‑Pérez, Kaelbling, *Integrated Task and Motion Planning*, 2021; Rawlings et al., MPC updates).\n\n7. **Quality‑Diversity (QD) search.**\n   **Adopt.** QD (e.g., CMA‑ME, 2020) justifies **set‑return** and archive semantics in `U.SelectionAndTuning`; E.TGA bans covert scalarization that would collapse archives to single “bests”.\n\n8. **Profunctor optics (modular projections).**\n   **Adopt/Adapt.** Optics motivate view/projection discipline behind MVPK faces; we adapt by forbidding MVPK faces from introducing new claims (they are pure projections, not transformations). (Pickering, Gibbons, Wu, **Profunctor Optics**, 2019).\n\n*Cross‑tradition note.* Items 1–3 (category‑theoretic), 4–5 (publication/reproducibility concepts), 6 (controls/robotics), 7 (evolutionary search), and 8 (PL/semantics) jointly anchor E.TGA across multiple traditions, per E.8.\n",

        "solution": "### E.19:4 - Solution — Profile-based gates for admission and refresh\n\nEstablish **Pattern Quality Gates (PQG)**: a conceptual review mechanism that applies **profiles of checks** rather than a single monolithic checklist.\n\nA **Pattern Check Profile (PCP)** is a named bundle of check families. Profiles are **additive**: every review applies a baseline profile, then adds risk-driven profiles as needed.\n\n**Terminology note (disambiguation).** PQG/PCP are editorial review constructs in the authoring plane (Part E). They are distinct from enactment/runtime gating constructs such as `OperationalGate(profile)` / `GateProfile` (A.21), which govern Work transitions and gate decision policies elsewhere in FPF.\n\n**Mint vs reuse.** This pattern mints **PQG**, **PCP**, and the profile IDs **PCP‑BASE/MOD/PRAG/NORM/SOTA/BRIDGE/TERM/DEONT/REFRESH**. It reuses existing FPF terms (e.g., **Delta‑Class**, **DRR**, **Bridge**, **CL**, **SoTA Synthesis Pack**) without changing their meanings.\n\n#### E.19:4.1 - Define the review target\n\nA review **SHOULD** propose revisions to a target pattern (including didactic restructuring) that positively affect downstream usage and interoperability. Formal/template defects (e.g., non‑compliance with E.8 structure or not conforming to RFC deontic terminology) have lower review priority than semantic/ontological defects or non‑SoTA Solutions, but they also **MUST** be corrected.\n\nE.g. if the header block is missing or incomplete, **continue with ontology and semantic review first**. Treat missing header fields as a mechanical defect to patch (PCP‑BASE #7), not as a reason to stop.\n\nThe run **SHOULD** give best-known **Delta‑Class (Δ‑0…Δ‑3)** and record an initial **impact radius** (dependent patterns/tests/relations that need be changed due to pattern norms), using existing definitions where available (e.g., the LEX‑AUTH protocol).\n\n#### E.19:4.2 - Apply the baseline profile to every run\n\nEvery run MUST include **PCP‑BASE**, reviewer depth SHOULD prioritize the load-bearing surfaces in E.19:4.2.1.\n\n1. **Internal coherence (problem ↔ contract ↔ solution)**\n   The Conformance Checklist matches Problem statement and the Solution (no “orphan requirements” and no “unclaimed obligations”).\n2. **Lexical discipline & reserved vocabulary**\n   Terms and registers follow lexical rules; ambiguous “everyday” synonyms do not silently replace kernel vocabulary.\n3. **SoTA‑Echoing minimum compliance (E.8)**\n   SoTA‑Echoing satisfies the E.8 obligations applicable to the pattern kind (Architectural vs Definitional), including post‑2015 sourcing and explicit adopt/adapt/reject stances. If a SoTA Synthesis Pack exists for the topic, SoTA‑Echoing binds to it rather than forking an untracked narrative; any divergence of pattern norms from contemporary practice is explicitly stated as such. SoTA‑Echoing **MUST** be non‑decorative: the Solution and other load‑bearing sections **MUST** align with the declared SoTA stance, or explicitly justify any divergence.\n4. **Cross-pattern compatibility & impact radius**\n   Relations are consistent with declared dependencies and dependents; declared scope/impact is compatible or explicitly limited.\n5. **Didactic grounding**\n   Archetypal Grounding is present and teaches the concept with concrete anchors, not only abstractions.\n6. **Template & section integrity**\n   This is lowest priority for review depth and **SHOULD NOT** consume effort that would displace ontology/semantics/modularity/slots/SoTA checks. \n7. **Modularity & contradiction hygiene**\n   The pattern **SHOULD NOT** be overloaded or expands obligations/dependencies  significantly. Checks include: scope hygiene, split/refactor recommendation when warranted, and contradiction scan against neighbor patterns in Relations. Pattern should respect balance of coheiseveness and coupling of its content among other patterns in FPF. If pattern define specialization it should not show mix of slots/parameters of different levels. \n\n##### E.19:4.2.1 - Triage: spend depth on load-bearing surfaces without making reviews heavier\n\nPQG is meant to increase *semantic and ontological trust*, not to turn every review into an exhaustive editorial audit on form. To keep reviews feasible while improving the important parts:\n\n* Treat **load-bearing surfaces** as the primary depth targets:\n  * the pattern’s **Conformance Checklist** (the enforceable contract): keep items universal, cognitively ergonomic, not overly prohibitive, and avoid duplicating checks that belong to other patterns (modularity),\n  * **deontic clauses** (`MUST/SHALL/SHOULD/MAY`) that define obligations on the authoring/validation plane (not laws of nature or mathematical facts; ensure an explicit conformance subject),\n  * **admissibility constraints** (`Invariant:` / `Well‑formedness constraint:`) that define valid models (cardinality, typing/kinds, totality) and are written as non‑deontic predicates (no RFC keywords inside the predicate),\n  * **definitions and mint/reuse decisions** (new terms, renamed terms, scope claims baked into names, names that are not overloaded and are properly chosen),\n  * **cross-context / cross-plane claims** (Bridge hygiene and “sameness” assertions),\n  * **SoTA** (when the pattern claims state‑of‑the‑art rather than a popular‑but‑outdated solution or vocabulary),\n  * **modularity and Slot discipline of A.6.5** that provide evolvability of FPF,\n  * **absence of contradictions in a pattern**,\n  * **Relations** that define compatibility and impact radius.\n* Treat **low-signal surfaces** as “scan-level” unless they change meaning: headings/formatting, micro-typos, stylistic polish, and non-load-bearing narrative refactors, compliance to deontic RFC.\n* **Do not block semantic review on template and RFC compliance defects.** Missing header block fields (E.8 H‑5), missing canonical sections, or a missing footer marker are fixable integrity defects. Patch them quickly and continue with the load-bearing surface checks in the same run.\n* **Report ordering (impact-first).** In run outputs and remediation patches, prioritize fixes on ontology, semantic, modularity and SoTA-related load-bearing surfaces first; group low-signal formatting/typos into a single hunk at the end unless they change meaning.\n\n#### E.19:4.3 - Add risk-driven profiles\n\n**PCP‑PRAG (Pragmatic utility & adoption)** — Trigger: the pattern is Normative and claims practice guidance.\nChecks include: minimally viable example, non-decorative Consequences/Anti-Patterns, and an explicit “So what?” adoption test.\n\n**PCP‑REFRESH (Staleness & compatibility refresh)** — Trigger: staleness signals are present (e.g., outdated SoTA rows, renamed/superseded Relations targets, terminology drift, or an explicit refresh window in LAT/DRR).\nChecks include:\n\n* refresh‑sensitive claims are identified (time‑bounded or ecosystem‑bounded) and either (a) updated with post‑2015 evidence **and** matching Solution changes, or (b) explicitly scope‑limited and labeled as historical lineage,\n* Relations are updated to current pattern IDs; deprecations/renames are handled via explicit continuity notes (no silent relabeling),\n* the run records a Delta‑Class and impact radius; if the refresh causes Δ‑2/Δ‑3, it emits/updates a DRR pointer and triggers any required harness/Bridge refresh obligations defined elsewhere (E.15/F.15/F.9).\n\nTrigger overrides are permitted but intentionally rare: a run MAY override a triggered profile only when it can show the trigger’s risk is genuinely absent *in this case*, and the record MUST name (a) why the trigger is a false positive here and (b) what compensating check(s) were applied instead.\n\n**PCP‑NORM (Normative contract integrity)** — Trigger: the pattern introduces or changes normative requirements, introduces new conformance items, or shifts downstream obligations.\nChecks include:\n\n* **Delta‑Class (Δ‑0…Δ‑3)** and **impact radius** are explicit (what breaks, who depends on this),\n* requirements are testable in principle (conceptually), scoped, and non-contradictory,\n* downstream patterns cited in Relations are compatible with the new contract.\n* where the change is Δ‑2/Δ‑3 or a new normative pattern is being admitted: a DRR exists and references the PQG findings (pointer is sufficient; no duplicated prose).\n\n**PCP‑SOTA (Evidence & SoTA alignment)** — Trigger: the pattern’s Solution asserts “best practice”, “state-of-the-art”, or introduces new synthesis claims.\nChecks include:\n\n* each “best practice / SoTA” claim in the Solution is explicitly **bound** to SoTA‑Echoing rows (or to SoTA Synthesis Pack identifiers when used), rather than floating as ungrounded prescription,\n* novel synthesis is not presented as established SoTA: it is either (a) framed as a scoped hypothesis with explicit limits, or (b) promoted into/registered as a SoTA Synthesis Pack entry before the pattern is admitted as normative guidance,\n* where traditions disagree materially, the pattern surfaces the disagreement and states why it adopts/adapts/rejects (instead of silently selecting one tradition),\n* refresh‑sensitive claims (those likely to decay) are explicitly marked with scope limits, timespan notes, or lineage labeling when appropriate.\n\n**PCP‑BRIDGE (Cross‑context/plane reuse integrity)** — Trigger: the pattern imports claims, terms, or norms across contexts, disciplines, or reference planes.\nChecks include:\n\n* explicit Bridge usage where required (no silent identity by spelling),\n* Congruence / loss is surfaced where applicable,\n* any cross-plane reuse is explicitly acknowledged and its penalties do not leak into unrelated assurances.\n\n**PCP‑TERM (Terminology & naming protocol)** — Trigger: the pattern introduces new terms, new U.Types, new “unified names”, or redefines existing labels.\nChecks include:\n\n* “mint vs reuse” decision is explicit,\n* naming follows the local-first naming protocol and avoids scope smuggling (roles/metrics/stages baked into labels; overloaded words used as terms with a local sense). Remediation **SHOULD** use F.18,\n* deprecated aliases and continuity rules are respected.\n\n**PCP-DEONT (Deontic clause hygiene - RFC keywords)** - Trigger: the pattern mismatch admissibility (like in laws in physics) and deontic laws (like in law enforcement). \nChecks include:\n* Deontic requirements are expressed with RFC-style keywords (see H‑8); \n* obligations are not smuggled into prose as informal imperatives. Admissibility/validity constraints are stated non‑deontically as `Invariant:` / `Well‑formedness constraint:` predicates and referenced from the Conformance Checklist when enforceable. \n* **Subject discipline for RFC keywords.** If a sentence uses RFC keywords, its grammatical subject **MUST** be an agent or a publishable artefact (author, reviewer, tool, model, record, validator). RFC keywords **MUST NOT** modify modeled‑world entities (e.g., “Earth”, “RoleAssignment”, “Role”, “holon”) — express those as `Invariant:` / `Well‑formedness constraint:` predicates instead, and (if needed) reference them from CC items.\n\n#### E.19:4.4 - Decision outcomes\n\nA PQG run **MUST** end with (a) a remediation patch (English, unified diff, fenced) and (b) a compact list of blocking findings.\n\n**Remediation payload (patch-first).** The run MUST provide concrete remediation proposals as a unified diff patch in English in a fenced code block (if patch is huge, acceptable have it in separate file to have all needed details without need to excess brevity), accompanied by a short commentary stating (a) the explicit misses found and (b) any remaining work that was intentionally deferred. This is a user interchange convention, not a tool mandate.\n\n**Report ordering (impact-first).** The patch is the primary artifact. In the short commentary, list findings in descending order of expected impact on semantic trust (load-bearing surfaces first). Template/formatting-only issues belong at the end unless they hide missing content.\n\n**Budget discipline (anti‑lint‑worship).** If the run identifies semantic defects in load-bearing surfaces, remediation MUST prioritize those fixes; purely mechanical edits (formatting, micro-typos) MUST be minimized and MUST NOT dominate the patch by volume.\n\n**Noise discipline.** The run record is a human-facing audit trail. It **SHOULD** be sparse: list findings, deferrals, and decisions; do **not** paste full PASS output. No need emitting per-check “passed” lines; only found problems and remediation/fixes matter.\n",
