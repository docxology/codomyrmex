CG constrains run‑time gate checks (E.TGA/E.18) by supplying the referenced `CG‑Spec` artifacts and pinned editions; CG itself is not an admissibility mechanism.\n\n**Didactic subtitle:** “Design‑time rules for safe, auditable comparison.”\n",

It informs exploration/refresh and tie‑breaks; it is **not** in the dominance set unless a **PromotionPolicy (lens/policy‑id)** is named.\n* **Partial orders.** Where only a partial order is lawful, **do not force total orders** in `ComparatorSet`; downstream (G.5) returns explicit non‑dominated sets.\n* **Guard macros.** Recommended set includes: `UNIT_CHECK`, `ORD_COMPARE_ONLY`, `FRESHNESS_CHECK`, `PLANE_NOTE`, `PHI_CL_MONOTONE(policy_id)`.\n\n#### G.0:5.2 - SoTAPalette\n\n1. **SoTAPalette (I).** Intensional profile of a discipline’s Traditions and method‑families with intentions and tolerances:\n* admissible TaskKinds/ObjectKinds,\n* required CHR types,\n* characteristic operators/proofs,\n* typical CL bridges (with known loss).\n\n2. **SoTAPaletteDescription (D).** Publication of the palette: \n* metadata of Traditions, \n* Operator & Object Inventory, \n* Bridge Matrix with CL/loss notes, \n* micro‑examples, \n* UTS drafts. \n \nThis is the “SoTA Synthesis Pack” of G.2 and must be citable in G.5 decisions.\n\n3. **SoTAPaletteSpec (S).** Minimal gates on completeness/quality of a palette: \n* coverage of Traditions/sub‑tasks, \n* minimum replications/carriers across KD‑CAL lanes (TA/LA/VA), \n* explicit CL penalties for reductions, and bans on illegal operations (e.g., ordinal ≠ mean). \n \nThese gates are consumed by CG‑Spec.Acceptance and Γ‑fold where cross‑Tradition comparison/aggregation is attempted\n\n#### G.0:5.3 - Tradition\n\n* In this framework, **“scientific/engineering Tradition/lineage/tradition” is an epistemic kind**: **`Tradition`** (I) with its **`TraditionDescription`** (D) and **`TraditionSpec`** (S).\n* The **community of people** behind a Tradition is modeled separately as an optional **`TraditionCarrier`** that _carries_ a `Tradition` but does **not** determine cross‑Tradition comparability rules.\n* In the **SoTA‑palette**, entries are **`Tradition`** items (epistemic) with their D/S artifacts; the palette composes them and exposes bridges/limits. The Dispatcher (G.5) selects among these entries under CHR/CAL constraints; CG‑Spec (G.0) only governs comparability/Γ‑fold where justified.\n\nTradition (I): an epistemic formation (Tradition‑of‑thought, lineage) identified by its method family:\n- operator set and admissible transformations,\n- admissible TaskKinds/ObjectKinds,\n- necessary CHR types and proof idioms,\n- canonical CL bridges and stated limits,\n- stance on measurement scales and allowed algebra.\n(Notes: This is an epistemic kind, not a social group. See §TraditionCarrier for the social carrier.)\n\nTraditionDescription (D): the documentary corpus of a Tradition:\n- charter/lineage and key references,\n- Operator & Object inventory with CHR preconditions,\n- Bridge Matrix (CL) with loss and validity regions,\n- Worked Examples with CHR annotations,\n- UTS drafts for typical tasks,\n- KD‑CAL lane coverage and replication notes,\n- explicit anti‑operators / banned reductions (e.g., ordinal ≠ mean).\n\nTraditionSpec (S): inclusion gates for a Tradition to be considered comparable/aggregable:\n- minimum replication across KD‑CAL lanes (TA/LA/VA),\n- declared CHR prerequisites and proof idioms,\n- declared CL penalties/conditions for any cross‑Tradition bridge,\n- Γ‑fold contribution rule (how evidence accumulates),\n- prohibitions on illegal scale algebra.\nThese S‑level gates are referenced by CG‑Spec.acceptance only where aggregation/comparison is attempted; otherwise the Tradition remains descriptive.\n\nTraditionCarrier (I): role of a social/organizational system (people, labs, consortia) that holds a Tradition. Carriers supply replication capacity and provenance but have no normative authority over cross‑Tradition aggregation rules.\n\nΓ‑fold: an evidence/reliability fold that aggregates only along declared commensurate dimensions; includes penalties from CL bridges and lane‑mismatch factors. Γ‑fold parameters MUST be cited to KD‑CAL lanes and Worked Examples; when absent, aggregation is disallowed.\n\nDefault composition: weakest‑link; admissible overrides: {min‑k‑of‑n, harmonic, conservative Bayesian}; override requires CAL.ProofLedger refs\n\n#### G.0:5.4 - Authoring Steps (S1–S6)\n\n**S1 - Frame Charter (Scope & describedEntity)**\nDeclare **Context**, **USM scope**, *describedEntity* (`GroundingHolon`, `ReferencePlane`), TaskKinds/ObjectKinds; record boundary examples and non‑examples.\n\n**S2 - ComparatorSet & SCP Draft**\nList **which** comparisons/aggregations the Frame intends (e.g., dominance, lexicographic, Pareto, affine sums on interval/ratio with unit alignment). Bind each comparator to **G.3/AggregationSpecs** and attach **GuardMacros**; capture legality/tolerance assumptions in the CG‑Spec **ScaleComplianceProfile (SCP)**. **Do not** scalarise partial orders; for ordinals, use medoid/median; **WeightedSum is forbidden** on mixed scale types.\n\n**S3 - Characteristics Binding**\nFor each comparison you intend to allow, bind the **CHR.Characteristic id** and required **Scale/Unit/Polarity**; if missing, author in **G.3** or reuse via UTS (F.8). For any numeric encoding of ordinals, publish **CoordinatePolicy** with non‑entitlements.\n\n**S4 - Minimal Evidence Gates**\nPer characteristic, declare **KD‑CAL lanes** (TA/LA/VA), required **carriers** (A.10), freshness/half‑life, and **Bridge/CL allowances**. Define **failure behavior**: **degrade to order‑only**, **sandbox**, or **abstain**.\n\nFor unit mismatches specify **sandbox (quarantine) or refuse**; **degrade.order is not permitted for unit mismatches under MM‑CHR**.\n\nMinimalEvidence MUST name **CHR.Characteristics** used by Acceptance/Flows and the **TaskSignature fields** they constrain (by id), so **G.5** can gate **before** selection.\n\n**S5 - Γ‑fold & CL Routing**\nSet default **Γ‑fold** for trust aggregation and the **CL penalty** table. Document proofs or references if overriding weakest‑link.\n\n**S6 - Publication & Tests**\nMint **UTS** Name Cards with twin labels; attach **loss notes** for Bridges. Register **RSCR** tests: (i) refuse illegal ops (e.g., mean on ordinal), (ii) enforce unit/scale checks, (iii) verify freshness/PathSlice handling, (iv) refuse illegal scalarisation of partial orders, (v) verify **CL → R_eff** routing and **Φ(policy‑id)** publication in SCR.\nAcceptance depends on (a) presence of SoTAPaletteDescription (G.2) with attached CHR/CAL evidence (G.3–G.4), and (b) justification of any aggregation via Γ‑fold (reliability fold) with explicit CL loss accounting. Where evidence is insufficient, acceptance MUST fall back to per‑Tradition reporting without cross‑Tradition aggregation.\n",

        "intent": "### G.5:1 - Intent\n\nProvide a **notation‑independent** architecture to register **families of methods** (LOG bundles) and to **select, combine, or fall back** among them for a concrete problem instance—*given typed characteristics (CHR), admissible calculi (CAL), and trust constraints (F–G–R).* The pattern embraces **No‑Free‑Lunch** realities: *there is no universal best method*, so selection is **trait‑ and evidence‑aware**, under explicit **explore↔exploit** policy. The selector returns a **Pareto set** and explicit **abstain/degrade** outcomes under **No‑Free‑Lunch**, governed by the **E/E‑LOG** policy lens. Optionally, the selector operates in **Quality‑Diversity (Illumination)** and **Open‑Ended Family** modes that (co‑)evolve solver families and, when registered, their task/environments; both modes remain **notation‑independent** and policy‑governed.\n",
        "problem": "### G.5:3 - Problem\n\nHow to design a **general, auditable selector** that:\n\n* prefers **well‑matched** methods for a task instance (shape, noise, constraints) *without* hard‑coding an algorithmic dogma;\n* respects **Bounded Contexts**, using **Bridges + CL** only when crossing (with penalties routed to **R**, never **F**);\n* explains *why* a choice was made and **how much trust** it buys (F–G–R) with a **SCR**;\n* remains free of **tooling jargon** and **implementation bias** at the Core level.   \n",
        "forces": "### G.5:4 - Forces\n\n* **Pluralism vs. dispatchability.** Competing Traditions expose different invariants; the selector must compare **without semantic flattening**.\n* **Evidence vs. formality.** **F** shapes expression rigor; **R** tracks support; **G** is scope—**orthogonal** yet interacting under composition. \n* **Local semantics vs. reuse.** Cross‑Context reuse requires **Bridges** with **CL** and **loss notes**; penalties hit **R_eff**, not F. \n* **Exploration vs. exploitation.** Run‑time must sometimes **probe alternatives** (NQD/E‑E), but within declared **risk envelopes**.\n",
        "solution": "### G.5:5 - Solution — *Dispatcher & Registry chassis*\n\n**Selection kernel.** Apply **lawful orders only**; for partial orders **return a set** governed by **`PortfolioMode ∈ {Pareto | Archive}`** (default **Pareto**; **Archive** when QD is active), no forced scalarisation; **unit/scale mismatches fail fast**. **Default `DominanceRegime = ParetoOnly`; inclusion of Illumination in dominance requires an explicit `CAL.Acceptance` policy and its policy‑id recorded in SCR.** Eligibility/Acceptance are **tri‑state**; unknowns behave per MethodFamily policy (**pass**/**degrade**/**abstain**) and are logged in **SCR** **together with MinimalEvidence verdicts for each referenced characteristic**; **gate additionally by CG‑Spec.minimal_evidence** (by Characteristic id) before applying orders. **SoS‑LOG rule sets (C.23) are the executable shells consumed here**; any **maturity floors** are enforced via **CAL.AcceptanceClause** (not by LOG). **Maturity is an ordinal poset; no global scalarisation is permitted in Core.**\n\n**Strategizing escalation.** When no admissible `MethodFamily` exists for the declared `TaskSignature`, the selector **MUST NOT fail closed**; it **SHALL** return an **empty `CandidateSet`** together with a **`Run‑safe Plan`** that includes an **`ActionHint=strategize`** (C.23 branch‑id), and—where registered—a **`GeneratorFamily`** stub (`EnvironmentValidityRegion`, `TransferRulesRef`). This escalates to **method creation/selection** under **E/E‑LOG**, avoiding ad‑hoc execution.\n\n**Telemetry & parity.** Open hooks for **G.11** (refresh) and **G.9** (parity/baselines). Route **CL penalties → R_eff only**; declare **ReferencePlane** for any claim; **record Φ(CL)/Φ_plane policy‑ids in SCR (Φ MUST be monotone and bounded)**; on plane/context crossings **cite Bridge ids**. When **Illumination** is active, compute and publish **Q (quality), D (diversity), and QD‑score** and the **Archive state**; **IlluminationSummary is a lawful telemetry summary over `Diversity_P`** and **does not enter dominance** unless an explicit **CAL** policy states otherwise **and its policy‑id is recorded in SCR**. **Any increase of Illumination MUST log `PathSliceId`, the active policy‑id, and the active editions of `DescriptorMapRef` and `DistanceDefRef`.**\n\n“Strategy” is a **composition** inside G.5 under **E/E‑LOG** governance; **no new U.Type ‘Strategy’** is minted (**Plain‑register only** per E.10).\n\n**S1 - MethodFamily Registry (design‑time, per CG-Frame)**\nDefine a **registry row** per *MethodFamily* (e.g., *Outranking*, *CDT*, *Active‑Inference*, *Pareto‑front MOMAs*, *Gradient‑based optimizer*, *RL policy search*), each row comprising:\n\n* **Identity:** local Context, lineage/Tradition, version, **UTS name card**;\n* **SolverSignature:** I/O contracts and invariants (types, units, monotonicity), objective kinds, side‑effect constraints;\n* **ValidityRegion:** declared TaskClass and tolerances (shape/conditioning/noise) for which guarantees apply; if applicable, **EnvironmentValidityRegion** (for co‑evolved tasks);\n* **Eligibility Standard** (typed): required **Object/Task kinds**, **Data shape/regularity traits**, **Noise/uncertainty model**, **Resource envelope**, **Scope prerequisites** (USM claims), **Evidence lanes per KD‑CAL** (e.g., VA/LA/TA) it relies on; **predicates MUST support tri‑state {true|false|unknown} and define a failure policy for `unknown` (degrade/abstain)**. If a “sandbox/probe‑only” route is desired, it MUST be modeled as a distinct **SoS‑LOG** branch (C.23) with a branch‑id and not as a fourth Acceptance status;\n* **Assurance profile:** **I/D/S** of the method artefact (e.g., `MethodDescription` vs `MethodSpec` per E.10.D2), **Formality F** anchored to **U.Formality** scale **F0…F9** (C.2.3), expected **R** lane(s), **CL** allowances for cross‑Context operation; **CL penalties SHALL route to R_eff only**;\n* **Guarantees:** accuracy/robustness/regret bounds and their preconditions; **EvidenceRefs** to **EvidenceGraph** paths supporting claims;\n* **CostModel** and **KnownFailures** (adversarial/degenerate cases);\n* **PolicyHooks:** E/E‑LOG knobs (exploration quota, risk budget); optional **EmitterPolicyRef** (C.19) when Illumination is used;\n* **BridgeUsage:** declared Bridges and **CL** allowances with loss notes for any cross‑Context transfer;\n* **Twin‑naming (E.10):** **Tech:** `U.DescriptorMapRef`; **require `d≥2` only when QD/illumination surfaces are active** (otherwise `d≥1` is lawful); **Plain twin:** `CharacteristicSpaceRef`. **Aliases between them are forbidden** (distinct objects);\n* When Illumination is used, declare `U.DescriptorMapRef.edition` and **pin all QD metrics to it**, together with **`DistanceDefRef.edition`** (diversity metric) and **`DHCMethodRef.edition`** to ensure reproducible fronts;\n* **InsertionPolicyRef** for archives (elitist replacement, **K‑capacity**, dedup/tie rules);\n* **Proof obligations** (what must be established before/after selection).\n* **Artefacts:** list **MethodDescription** ids (UTS); where harnessed, also **MethodSpec** ids; cross‑Context reuse requires Bridges + CL.\n\n  All fields are **Core‑level concepts**; concrete notations live in Tooling per **E.5.1–E.5.3**. Publish to **UTS** with twin labels and loss notes if bridged. \n\n**S1′ - GeneratorFamily Registry (design‑time, Open‑Ended mode)**\nRegister **GeneratorFamily** (POET/Enhanced‑POET‑class) entries that (co‑)evolve **tasks/environments** and solvers. Each row declares:\n* **GeneratorSignature** (I/O, state, budget semantics), **EnvironmentValidityRegion**, **TransferRules** (when/what to transfer across environments) with **`TransferRulesRef.edition` (mandatory in OEE mode)**, **CoEvoCouplers** (which MethodFamilies co‑evolve), **Stop/Refresh** conditions;\n* **SoS‑LOG/Acceptance hooks** (discipline‑level gates for validity of generated tasks); any thresholds live in CAL.Acceptance (not LOG);\n* **Publication shape:** the selector returns portfolios of pairs `{Environment, MethodFamily}` with their **Eligibility/Assurance** and **PortfolioMode**; telemetry records **coverage/regret** and **IlluminationSummary** (**edition‑aware**, pinned to `DescriptorMapRef.edition` and `DistanceDefRef.edition`).\n\n**S2 - TaskSignature & Trait Inference (design‑time + run‑time)**\nA **TaskSignature** is a *minimal typed record* the dispatcher consumes:\n`⟨Context, TaskKind, KindSet:U.Kind[], DataShape, NoiseModel, ObjectiveProfile, Constraints{incl. ResourceEnvelope}, ScopeSlice(G), EvidenceGraphRef, Size/Scale, Freshness, Missingness, PortfolioMode⟩`. Values are **CHR‑typed** (Characteristics/Scales/Levels/Coordinates per MM‑CHR discipline) with provenance. Traits may be **inferred** from CHR/CAL bindings (e.g., *convexity known? differentiable? ordinal vs interval scales?*) and from **USM** scope metadata. **When Illumination is active**, extend with `QualityDiversity: {DescriptorMapRef (Tech; d≥2), CharacteristicSpaceRef (Plain twin)}`, `ArchiveConfig (grid/CVT cells)`, `EmitterPolicyRef`, `InsertionPolicyRef`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, `Q‑budget/D‑budget`. Descriptor and space are distinct objects (no aliases) and must be provided as twins.\n**Design/Run hygiene.** No mixed‑stance signatures; GateCrossings publish Bridge+UTS and record **Φ(CL)/Φ_plane** ids.\n**UnknownHandling:** all fields admit `unknown` (tri‑state {true|false|unknown}); **Missingness semantics MUST align with CHR.Missingness** (MCAR/MAR/MNAR or mapped equivalents) and be honored by Acceptance/Flows.\n\n**S3 - Selection Kernel (run‑time, policy‑governed)**\n**No‑Free‑Lunch is enforced**: choose Tradition/Operator sets from the SoTAPaletteDescription conditioned on task/object/CHR preconditions, rather than by “universal” cross‑Tradition formulas in CG‑Spec. Selector decisions MUST cite palette entries and CHR/CAL constraints used. **CG‑Spec MUST NOT override this with one‑size‑fits‑all formulas.**\n\nThe selector MUST:\n\n(1) read SoTAPaletteDescription,\n(2) filter Traditions by CHR preconditions and KD‑CAL lane fit,\n(3) pick operators consistent with declared scales and taboos,\n(4) emit a rationale with links to palette entries and Worked Examples.\n\nA **pure selector** computes a **CandidateSet** with an **admissible (possibly partial) order** (no illegal cross‑scale scoring) and constrained by an *AssuranceGate*:\n\n1. **Eligibility filter:** `MethodFamily` passes iff all **Eligibility Standard** predicates hold **and** all **CG‑Spec.MinimalEvidence** gates for referenced characteristics are met; **if CG‑Frame uses NQD, enforce `ConstraintFit=pass` before front selection**; otherwise **abstain**. Where a “sandbox/probe‑only” route is intended, express it via a dedicated **SoS‑LOG** branch (C.23) with a branch‑id; Acceptance remains tri‑state {pass|degrade|abstain}.\n2. **CG‑Spec gate:** require all **CHR characteristics** referenced by Acceptance/Flows to meet the **CG‑Spec.minimal\\_evidence** in the current Context; otherwise **abstain** under E/E‑LOG. If a probe‑only path is needed, route via a dedicated **SoS‑LOG** branch (C.23).\n3. **Admissible preference:** apply **lexicographic** precedence over lawful traits (e.g., *assumption fit* ≻ *evidence alignment* ≻ *resource/cost*). **Weighted sums across mixed scale types (ordinal vs interval/ratio) are forbidden**; prefer lexicographic/medoid/median where lawful; **any unit/scale conversions MUST be proven legal via CSLC (A.18) before aggregation**.\n4. **F–G–R aware gating:** compute **R_eff** with **Γ‑fold** (default = weakest‑link; **override only if CAL/EvidenceProfile supplies an alternative with proofs of monotonicity & boundary behavior**) and apply **CL** penalties (R_eff only; F and G invariant); block candidates failing *minimum R*; **record Γ‑fold contributors explicitly in SCR**. **F** is read from method formalisation level; **G** from **USM** slice; penalties **never alter F**. \n5. **Partial‑order handling:** if after gating the order is not total, **return a Pareto (non‑dominated) set** and explain tie‑criteria in DRR/SCR; do not force a total order via illegal scalarization.\n6. **Explore↔Exploit policy:** under **E/E‑LOG**, admit a quota of **NQD‑emitted** alternatives (guarded by risk budgets) to avoid local optima; log probes and outcomes for **refresh**. In **Illumination** mode, selection produces/updates an **Archive** (cells/niches) and computes **Q/D/QD‑score** per edition; ordering within a niche remains lawful (lexicographic/median), never cross‑scale weighted sums.\n\n**S4 - Composition & Fallbacks (design‑time templates)**\nProvide templates for **composed strategies**: (i) *pre‑conditioners* (e.g., rescale/denoise), (ii) *meta‑selectors* (e.g., *small‑n* vs *large‑n* switch), (iii) *cascade fallbacks* on **Assurance failure** (e.g., degrade objective from cardinal to ordinal when CHR forbids interval arithmetic). Guard with **CSLC (A.18)** for **unit/scale legality**; **disallow illegal ordinal arithmetic**.\nAdd a **Verifier stage**: on run‑time preconditions failing or **evidence freshness** expiring, trigger the next lawful fallback; emit DRR/SCR deltas.\n\n**S5 - Publication & Telemetry**\nEach selection produces a **Decision Rationale Record (DRR)** + **SCR**, citing chosen family, **why**, **CG‑Spec ids and characteristics consulted with MinimalEvidence verdicts (per characteristic & lane)**, **Γ‑fold contributors**, **ReferencePlane & CL^plane usage**, **CL penalties**, expected **R_eff**, and any **explore** probes. Register the family and selection policy to **UTS** **with twin labels and loss notes where bridged**; provide **RSCR** parity/regression tests as conformance artefacts. **Record on‑policy outcomes and off‑policy regret signals via telemetry (G.11)** to support registry refresh.  \n\n**If Illumination is active,** also publish **IlluminationSummary** (Q/D/QD‑score, Archive snapshot, coverage/regret) and `DescriptorMapRef.edition` with `DistanceDefRef.edition`/`DHCMethodRef.edition`; in **Open‑Ended** mode publish `{Environment, MethodFamily}` portfolios with their coverage **and record `TransferRulesRef.edition`**. **Exports also include:** a **Dispatcher Report** (candidates and reasons in/out), a **Portfolio Pack** (_Pareto set_ + tie‑break notes), and a **Run‑safe Plan** (flows + legality proofs).\n\nFor any **Illumination increase**, telemetry **MUST** record the **`PathSliceId`**, the **active policy‑id**, and the active **editions** of `DescriptorMapRef` and `DistanceDefRef`; **in Open‑Ended (GeneratorFamily) mode it MUST also record `TransferRulesRef.edition`**. These **MUST** be visible to **RSCR** triggers.\n\n**S6 - Governance & Evolution**\n\n* **Unidirectional dependency:** Registry and selector are Core patterns; implementations are Tooling; tutorials are Pedagogy.\n* **Change control:** versioned entries; deprecations flow through **Lexical Continuity** and **Worked‑Examples** refresh.\n\n> **Julia‑style specialisation (design idiom).** Use **trait‑like dispatch** and **parametric specialisation** *at the level of typed Standards*, not code, to keep selection semantics **portable** across languages and stacks. The Core remains **notation‑independent**.\n",

        "solution": "### G.6:4 - Solution — **EvidenceGraph** (notation‑independent; lane‑aware; path‑addressable)\n\n**4.1 Definition (object).**\nAn **EvidenceGraph** is a **typed DAG** whose nodes are the **A.10 anchors/carriers and evidencing roles** and whose edges are minimal, normative provenance relations. Each node/edge carries attributes sufficient for the B.3 trust calculus and E.10 lexical discipline; edges never build mereology (A.10 firewall).\n\n* **Nodes (informative types)**: `U.EvidenceRole` (holder = `U.Episteme`), `SymbolCarrier`, `TransformerRole` (external), `MethodDescription` (design), `Observation` (dated result); all resolvable to **SCR/RSCR** rows. **When QD/illumination or portfolio selection is involved (C.18/C.19), nodes MAY carry:** `U.DescriptorMapRef` **(with** `edition` **and** `DistanceDef` **ids)**, `ArchiveCellRef`, `EmitterPolicyRef`, and `InsertionPolicyRef` (K‑capacity & replacement semantics) **as attributes**.\n* **Edges (normative vocabulary, minimal):** `verifiedBy` (formal line), `validatedBy` (empirical line), `fromWorkSet` (run‑time provenance), `happenedBefore` (temporal), `derivedFrom`.  \n* **Informative only:** `usedCarrier`, `interpretedBy` MAY appear in SCR narratives but are not part of the normative edge set. **No mereology** here; structural relations publish via CT2R‑LOG.\n* **Lane tags:** every binding is typed with **assuranceUse ∈ {TA, VA, LA}** and kept separable through to the assurance tuple and SCR display.\n* **Context & Plane:** nodes and claims declare `U.BoundedContext` and **ReferencePlane**; any crossing uses a **Bridge** with **CL / CL^k / CL^plane** and **loss notes**, and **penalises only R** via published, table‑backed **Φ/Ψ** policies.\n* **Freshness/decay:** empirical bindings declare **time windows**; on expiry they incur **Epistemic Debt** that must be resolved via refresh/deprecate/waive; proofs may fence to a **TheoryVersion** (no decay). **Editioned telemetry** MUST cite `PathSliceId` and any `U.DescriptorMapRef.edition` used to compute Illumination/QD metrics.\n* **No self‑evidence:** evidencing `TransformerRole` is **external** to the evaluated holon.\n\n**4.2 PathId (address for justifications)**.\nA **PathId** is a **stable identifier** minted for a **claim‑local, lane‑typed path** in an EvidenceGraph under a declared **TargetSlice** (Scope G with Γ\\_time selector) and **ReferencePlane**. PathIds are **editioned**; they denote a **proof spine** from the claim to carriers and include: the **lane split**, the **lowest CL on the path**, the **Γ‑fold in effect** (default = WLNK), **policy‑ids** **Φ(CL)** **and, if applicable,** **Φ\\_plane**, and **valid‑until** (freshness) for empirical legs. PathIds are **citable from SoS‑LOG** and **UTS**; missing or stale PathIds **forbid maturity rung advance**.\n\n**4.3 PathSliceId (time‑ & plane‑lifted slice).**\nA **PathSliceId := PathId × Γ_time window × ReferencePlane**. It keys **release‑quality snapshots** and enables **path‑granular refresh** (G.11) when freshness or bridges change. **If QD/illumination is present, the PathSliceId MUST also pin** `U.DescriptorMapRef.edition` **and** `DistanceDefRef.edition` **to make front/coverage snapshots reproducible.** A PathSliceId MUST declare its Γ_time selector and plane; crossings require Bridge + CL^plane and route penalties to R only.\n\n**4.4 Computation hooks (reusing B.3 & G.4, not redefining).**\n\n* **Γ‑fold & penalties.** Unless justified otherwise in **CAL.ProofLedger**, **R** aggregates by **weakest‑link**, then applies **Φ(CL_min)**, any applicable **Ψ(`CL^k`)** (where a **KindBridge** is traversed), and **Φ_plane** (all **bounded, monotone**), and is **clipped**: `R_eff := max(0, …)`. **F = min**. **G** composes as **intersection along a path**; **SpanUnion** across **independent** lines only (see CC‑G6‑10/12). Penalties **never** modify F/G. **All numeric operations MUST be lawful per CG‑Spec (declared characteristic, unit/scale, Γ‑fold); illegal mixes trigger fail‑fast and RSCR.**\n* **Lane separation.** Evidence lanes remain **separable** through to the assurance surface and SCR; no averaging across lanes.\n* **Exposure to SCR.** Every path resolves to **SCR/RSCR** entries; the **Assurance SCR** displays node/edge values, describedEntity and plane, **TA/VA/LA table**, **valid‑until/decay**, and **Epistemic‑Debt**. **Mandatory fields:** lane‑split, **Γ‑fold contributors** (with ids), **Φ(CL)**/**Φ\\_plane policy‑ids**, **PathId/PathSliceId**, and, when QD/illumination is involved, `U.DescriptorMapRef.edition` and `DistanceDefRef.edition` ids.\n* **Reuse across Contexts.** Any cross‑Context/plane reuse must cite **Bridge ids + loss notes**; penalties route to **R\\_eff only**; **policy‑ids** for Φ/Ψ are published in the SCR and CG‑Spec.\n\n**4.5 Conceptual API (notation‑independent surface).**\n\n* `Explain(pathId)` → returns lane‑split, **min R\\_i**, **CL\\_min**, applied **Φ/Ψ** policy‑ids, **valid‑until**, and the **contributing EvidenceProfile ids**.\n* `PathsFor(claim, TargetSlice, plane)` → enumerates admissible paths, ordered by WLNK cutset; returns **PathId\\[]**.\n* `Snapshot(pathId | pathSliceId)` → emits an **RSCR‑grade** snapshot (for release, UTS) with **twin labels**; when a **PathSliceId** is provided, the snapshot is **time‑local** (no reweave).\n  (These are **conceptual shapes**, not APIs; per E.5 they stay tool‑neutral.)\n\n**4.6 RSCR triggers (conceptual).**\nEdits that change **computed values (Score or telemetry signals) or acceptance**, **Φ/Ψ policies**, **Bridge CL**, or **Γ‑fold** for a path **trigger RSCR**; **QD/OEE‑related edits** (e.g., `U.DescriptorMapRef.edition`/`DistanceDef`, `EmitterPolicyRef`, `InsertionPolicyRef`) **also trigger RSCR**.

do **not** borrow a Context‑local Tech label as a “global” name. \n* **Publishes/Consumes.** **Publishes:** UTS row; **Consumes:** A.10 anchor metadata.\n* **Invariants.** Cross‑Context sameness is **Bridge‑only**; the UTS row lists Bridges with **CL** and a short **loss note**.\n\n#### G.6:8.2 - **H2 — UTS PathCard (PathId/PathSliceId)**\n\n**Trigger.** A new **PathId** (or **PathSliceId**) is minted for a claim.  \n**Obligation.** Publish a **UTS Name Card** with twin labels for the Path (or PathSlice), listing **Context, ReferencePlane, Γ_time**, and cited **Bridge ids + CL/CL^plane** (with loss notes). **If present, include** `U.DescriptorMapRef.edition` **and** `DistanceDefRef.edition` **ids.**  \n* **Invariants.** **F/G invariants never mutate** due to CL penalties; penalties reduce **R only**. **Illumination/QD signals do not alter dominance unless a selection policy (C.19) explicitly declares it; such policy ids MUST be cited.**\n\n#### G.6:8.3 - **H3 — RSCR Trigger on Evidence‑Impacting Edit (with Bridge Sentinels)**\n\n* **Trigger.** Any edit in G.6 that can change **computed values (Score or telemetry signals), acceptance verdicts, Γ‑fold contributors, or `R_eff`**; examples: freshness/decay change; Bridge **CL/CL^k** or loss update; **Φ/Ψ** policy change; lane tag correction; ReferencePlane correction; **QD/OEE artefact updates** (`U.DescriptorMapRef.edition`/`DistanceDef`, `EmitterPolicyRef`, `InsertionPolicyRef`, archive K‑capacity).\n* **Obligation.** Emit a **typed RSCR trigger**; the corresponding regression test must verify: (i) legality of CHR ops in affected flows, (ii) unit/scale checks, (iii) **CL→`R_eff` routing only**, (iv) presence of Φ policy‑ids in the SCR. \n* **Publishes/Consumes.** **Publishes:** RSCR test id(s); **Consumes:** CAL.EvidenceProfiles, CAL.Acceptance, Φ‑policies.\n* **Invariants.** **F/G invariants never mutate** due to CL penalties; penalties reduce **R only**.\n\n#### G.6:8.4 - **H4 — SoS‑LOG Path Citation (Selector Explainability)**\n\n* **Trigger.** A **C.23 SoS‑LOG** rule returns {**Admit | Degrade(mode) | Abstain**} for a `(TaskSignature, MethodFamily)` pair.\n* **Bridge Sentinels.** All **Bridge ids** referenced by live **PathIds/PathSliceIds** are **watch‑listed**; any change to **CL/CL^plane** or **Φ policy id** triggers **path‑local RSCR** on the affected set of Paths/Slices only.\n* **Obligation.** The LOG branch **MUST** cite **EvidenceGraph `PathId`(s)** that justify the decision, together with **lane tags (TA/VA/LA)**, freshness windows, **Bridge ids + loss notes** (if any), and Φ policy‑ids. **When the decision relies on QD/illumination or portfolio telemetry, the citation MUST include** `U.DescriptorMapRef.edition`, the relevant `EmitterPolicyRef`/`InsertionPolicyRef` **ids, and the** **lens id** *(per C.19)* **if a lens was used.**\n* **Publishes/Consumes.** **Publishes:** SCR‑visible branch record with `PathId`; **Consumes:** EvidenceGraph API path query.\n* **Invariants.** **No self‑evidence**; cross‑plane penalties **MUST** be monotone, bounded, and table‑backed.\n\n#### G.6:8.5 - **H5 — Maturity Rung Transition Justification**\n\n* **Trigger.** A `MethodFamily.MaturityCard@Context` rung change is proposed.\n* **Obligation.** The transition **MUST** be justified by one or more **EvidenceGraph paths** and then **published on UTS**; **missing anchors ⇒ no advance**.\n* **Publishes/Consumes.** **Publishes:** updated UTS entry for the MaturityCard; **Consumes:** EvidenceGraph paths and A.10 anchors.\n* **Invariants.** Maturity is an **ordinal poset**, not a global scalar; any gating thresholds live **only** in **AcceptanceClauses** and are cited by id from LOG (no thresholds inside LOG). \n\n#### G.6:8.6 - **H6 — Bridge/CL Edge Annotation (GateCrossings)**\n\n* **Trigger.** An EvidenceGraph edge crosses a **GateCrossing boundary** (Context/kind/plane/design↔run/edition).\n* **Obligation.** Record a **`BridgeCard`** (when a Bridge is involved) and publish a **UTS crossing row** with: `fromCtxState→toCtxState` (E.18 `CtxState = ⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`), Context ids (D.CTX), **Bridge id** (if any), **bridgeChannel**, **CL** (and **CL^k** if KindBridge), **ReferencePlane**(s), and **CL^plane** (if planes differ). **No implicit crossings**.\n* **Publishes/Consumes.** **Publishes:** UTS crossing row; **Consumes:** GateCrossing metadata.\n* **Invariants.** CL/CL^plane penalties **route to R only**; lanes are **explicit**.\n\n#### G.6:8.7 - **H7 — ReferencePlane Penalty Publication**\n\n* **Trigger.** A claim/evidence path spans different **ReferencePlanes** `{world|concept|episteme}`.\n* **Obligation.** Compute and publish **Φ\\_plane** (policy id + loss note) alongside **Φ(CL)**; both policies are **monotone, bounded, table‑backed**; report in SCR for any affected verdict. **Publish ids, not tables; values live in CAL.Acceptance/Φ‑policy registries.** \n* **Publishes/Consumes.** **Publishes:** SCR fields with Φ policy‑ids; **Consumes:** CAL.EvidenceProfiles row(s).\n* **Invariants.** Penalties affect **`R_eff`** only; **F/G** remain invariant.\n\n#### G.6:8.8 - **H8 — CrossingSurface Exposure (E.18)**\n\n* **Trigger.** G.6 exports are bundled for release or consumed by selectors.\n* **Obligation.** Provide inputs so that GateCrossing checks can run against **EvidenceGraph paths and published CrossingSurfaces** (**E.18:CrossingSurface**):\n  * FAIL if any required **CrossingSurface** is missing (`CrossingRef` + matching UTS row + required pins).\n  * FAIL if lane purity is violated (**CL/CL^k/CL^plane → R only**; F/G invariant).\n  * EXPOSE penalty policy ids (`Φ(CL)`, `Φ_plane`, `Ψ(CL^k)` where used) as **`PolicyIdRef`** bundles (policy-id + `PolicySpecRef` + `MintDecisionRef?`; F.8:8.1) so checks can verify monotonicity/bounds and mint/reuse provenance without implying any tool format.\n* **Publishes/Consumes.** **Publishes:** harness-readable identifiers (no formats mandated); **Consumes:** GateCrossing + lane tags.\n* **Invariants.** LEX hygiene (head-anchoring, I/D/S) holds for all exported tokens.\n\n#### G.6:8.9 - **H9 — SCR Surface for Assurance**\n\n* **Trigger.** Selector reports or acceptance checks reference evidence.\n* **Obligation.** Expose **lane‑split**, freshness windows, **Γ‑fold** contributors, **Φ(CL/plane)** policy‑ids, **IndependenceCertificate ids** (if SpanUnion), and (where present) **ProofLedger** references **as SCR‑visible fields**. \n* **Publishes/Consumes.** **Publishes:** SCR views; **Consumes:** CAL.Acceptance, CAL.ProofLedger, EvidenceGraph paths.\n* **Invariants.** **WLNK default = weakest‑link** unless proved otherwise; any override cites monotonicity/boundary proofs.\n\n#### G.6:8.10 - **H10 — ProofLedger Linkage (CAL ↔ G.6)**\n\n* **Trigger.** A formal proof obligation or evidence role is attached to a claim.\n* **Obligation.** Link the EvidenceGraph node/edge to **CAL.ProofLedger** entries and **A.10 carriers** via `verifiedBy/validatedBy` relations; **SCR/RSCR anchors are mandatory** for all carriers. **No self‑evidence**. \n* **Publishes/Consumes.** **Publishes:** ProofRef ids in the path; **Consumes:** CAL.ProofLedger entries.\n* **Invariants.** **TA/VA/LA** distinctions remain explicit; tool qualification belongs to **TA**.\n\n#### G.6:8.11 - **H11 — Telemetry Ingest (Selector & Probe Outcomes)**\n\n* **Trigger.** Run‑time **selector** or **probe** outcomes (E/E‑LOG) return observations that bear on previously asserted claims; **this includes QD/illumination updates and OEE `GeneratorFamily` events** (environment edits/transfers).\n* **Obligation.** Ingest as **external evidence lines** into the EvidenceGraph with proper **lane typing** (LA/VA/TA), **Context slice** and **Γ\\_time**; record **edition‑aware fields** when applicable: `U.DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDef`, `ArchiveCellRef`, `EmitterPolicyRef`, `InsertionPolicyRef`, the **policy‑id**, and the **lens id** *(per C.19)* used by the selector. For OEE events, capture `EnvironmentValidityRegion` and `TransferRules` references. Opening/closing of refresh windows produces **DRR/RSCR hooks** outside the Core text. *This hook wires G.6 to G.11 Telemetry/Refresh while keeping Core prose tool‑agnostic as required by E.5.*\n* **Publishes/Consumes.** **Publishes:** new EvidenceGraph nodes/edges + UTS rows; **Consumes:** selector/probe attestation (as conceptual carriers) **and (when present) GeneratorFamily attestations**.\n* **Invariants.** Separate **ΔR / ΔF** from **ΔG** in rationale (Assurance calculus discipline). **Illumination increments are logged as editioned deltas; they do not change dominance unless declared by policy (C.19).**\n\n#### G.6:8.12 - Minimal conformance (hooks)\n\n1. **UTS publication (H1)** for every minted evidence artefact; Bridges carry **CL + loss note**.\n2. **RSCR triggers (H3)** on any edit impacting computed values (Score/telemetry signals), acceptance, Γ‑fold, or Φ penalties.\n3. **LOG path citation (H4)** is mandatory for **all** Admit/Degrade/Abstain decisions; **no self‑evidence**. \n4. **Maturity rung transitions (H5)** **forbid** advancement without EvidenceGraph paths and UTS publication.\n5. **Gate‑crossings (H6/H7)** publish **Bridge + CL/CL^plane** and route penalties to **R only**; **no implicit crossings**.\n6. **GateCrossing visibility harness (H8).** Crossings pass **CrossingSurface** attestation (**E.18/A.27/F.9**), **LanePurity**, and **Lexical SD** (**E.10**) under GateChecks/GateProfile (**A.21**).\n7. **SCR surface (H9)** exposes lane split, Γ‑fold, Φ‑policies, ProofRefs; default **WLNK** unless proved otherwise.\n8. **ProofLedger linkage (H10)** ties formal/empirical roles to **A.10 carriers**; **SCR/RSCR anchors** present.\n\n",
        "consequences": "### G.6:9 - Consequences\n\n**Benefits.** Path‑addressable provenance; transparent **CL** and decay; clean **DesignRunTag**; selectors and auditors share the *same* object; **R** penalties become explainable deltas rather than folklore.\n**Trade‑offs.** Authors must declare freshness and planes; mitigated by reusing G.4 **EvidenceProfiles** instead of duplicating fields.\n",

If planes differ, compute **CL^plane** and attach **Φ_plane** (policy‑id + loss note). **Plane penalties SHALL NOT mutate `CL`**; they **only reduce `R_eff` via Φ_plane**. Crossing **≥ 2 planes MAY be policy‑blocked** (Φ_plane = block) unless a documented Waiver is cited. **F/G remain invariant.**\n2. **Counter‑example duty.** Assign **CL/CL^k** only if you can state at least one **counter‑example** for ≤ 2, or explain its absence for 3 (**honesty rule**).\n3. Penalty policies. Reference **Φ(CL)** (Scope) and, where applicable, **Ψ(CL^k)** (Kind), and **Φ_plane** — all **monotone, bounded, table‑backed** — used by your CG‑Frame. **Route penalties to `R_eff` only; F/G invariant.**\n4. Row scope (by reference). For Concept‑Set rows supported by Bridges, apply **F.7** row rules: **Row CL(min) = bottleneck** (no averages) and include a counter‑example when any cell carries a loss note. (Do not restate them here.)\n5. Stability check. Run the **BCT Regression Set**; if CL/CL^k/CL^plane changes, attach the regression delta, update **SentinelSet**, and emit **Telemetry(PathSlice)** with `policy‑id`(s) and any affected **DescriptorMapRef.edition** or **DistanceDefRef.edition**.\n\n**S3 - Publish crossings to UTS & Evidence surfaces.**\nEvery GateCrossing emits a UTS row listing `fromCtxState→toCtxState` (E.18 `CtxState = ⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`), `Context ids`, `Bridge id` (if any), `bridgeChannel`, `CL` (and `CL^k` if KindBridge), `ReferencePlane(s)`, and `CL^plane` (if planes differ). **SCR shows the policy‑ids for Φ(CL), Ψ(CL^k) (if used), and Φ_plane** and cites the **BCT id** and **RegressionSet id**. (No implicit crossings.)\n\n**S4 - Register Bridge Sentinels (watch‑list).**\nAll **Bridge ids** referenced by live **EvidenceGraph `PathId`/`PathSliceId`** are **watch‑listed**. On any change in **CL/CL^k/CL^plane** or **Φ/Ψ policy‑id**, emit **path‑local RSCR** triggers (per **H3/H4**) and schedule refresh **per PathSlice** (Γ_time × plane), not per pack. Where Bridges reference **DescriptorMapRef** or **DistanceDef**, any **edition change** also triggers sentinels and publishes an edition note to Telemetry.\n\n**S5 - Dispatcher & DHC hooks.**\nG.5 may only compare across Traditions when a Bridge exists; selection uses admissible orders, **bans cross‑ordinal scalarisation**, and applies **CL/CL^k/CL^plane penalties to R only**. **SoS‑LOG (C.23) gates** accompany any cross‑Tradition choice; **Acceptance (G.4)** holds thresholds/unknowns. For illumination/QD comparisons, G.5 must cite the **DescriptorMapRef.edition** and the **DistanceDefRef.edition** exposed by **G.7**.

This pattern **packages** the rule sets and maturity description defined elsewhere, so G.5 can lawfully dispatch portfolios/archives while keeping thresholds in **Acceptance** and justifications in **EvidenceGraph** paths. **It does not redefine SoS‑LOG semantics** (see **C.23**).\n**Modularity note.** The bundle cleanly separates **LOG decisions** (C.23) from **Acceptance thresholds** (G.4), **evidence wiring** (G.6), **selection semantics** (G.5), and **refresh/decay** (G.11); each module evolves independently under **E.18 GateCrossing** + **A.21 DecisionLog** discipline (no hidden crossings; no silent policy-id minting — policy-ids are reference-only and must be resolvable via `PolicySpecRef` (+ `MintDecisionRef` when newly minted) per F.8:8.1).\n",

This operationalizes the “coordinates with G.12” promise in **C.21**. \n**Modularity note.** G.12 consumes CHR/CAL/LOG artefacts and emits UTS‑published dashboard rows; formats (e.g., RO‑Crate/ORKG/OpenAlex) remain Annex/Interop and do **not** affect Core conformance (per **G.10**, **E.5.2**). \n",

        "problem": "### G.12:2 - Problem frame\n\nTeams publish “field health” numbers with mixed scales, hidden re‑parameterisations, and cross‑Context roll‑ups that violate Γ‑fold/Bridge discipline. Ordinal quantities (e.g., standardisation stages) get averaged; QD/coverage signals are smuggled into dominance. No one pins **editions** of descriptor spaces or distances, so dashboards silently drift. We need a **generation‑first** pattern that computes DHC time‑series **legally** and **refreshes selectively** when telemetry indicates illumination/edition changes or decay.  \n",
        "forces": "### G.12:3 - Forces\n\n* **Assurance vs. results.** Dashboards must *increase the chance of good results*, not only audit them; legality remains visible. \n* **No‑Free‑Lunch.** Selection returns **sets** under partial orders; dashboards must respect this and never coerce to totals. \n* **Telemetry vs. order.** **IlluminationSummary** (*Q/D/QD‑score*) is a **telemetry summary**; coverage/regret are **telemetry metrics**. None affect dominance unless a CAL **policy‑id** explicitly promotes them (recorded in SCR). \n* **Edition‑awareness.** QD/OEE parity requires **`.edition` on …Ref** for spaces/distances/transfer rules; telemetry must carry **policy‑id** and **PathSliceId** so G.11 can refresh slices, not packs.  \n* **Bridge hygiene & planes.** Cross‑Context/plane comparisons cite **Bridge id + CL** and **Φ/Φ_plane**; penalties reduce **R_eff** only. \n",
