# Data Visualization - Technical Overview

This document provides a detailed technical overview of the Data Visualization module.

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

<!-- TODO: Reiterate the module's core purpose from the main README, but with more technical depth. For example:
The Data Visualization module is responsible for generating a variety of common plot types (scatter, line, bar, histogram, heatmap) from provided datasets. It aims to offer a simple and consistent interface for other modules or users to quickly visualize data, primarily leveraging libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. It solves the problem of needing quick, scriptable, and reproducible visualizations within the Codomyrmex ecosystem.
-->

## 2. Architecture

<!-- TODO: Describe the internal architecture of the module. Include diagrams if helpful.
For example:
The module's architecture is straightforward, primarily centered around a `plotter.py` script or a set of functions that take data and plotting parameters as input and return or save plot images.
-->

- **Key Components/Sub-modules**:
  - `plot_scatter()`: Generates scatter plots.
  - `plot_line()`: Generates line plots.
  - `plot_bar()`: Generates bar charts.
  - `plot_histogram()`: Generates histograms.
  - `plot_heatmap()`: Generates heatmaps.
  - (Potentially a common utility function for saving plots or handling data input if applicable)
- **Data Flow**: 
  <!-- TODO: How does data move through the module? For example:
  Typically, structured data (e.g., pandas DataFrame, lists of numbers) and plot configuration parameters are passed to one of the plotting functions. The function then uses a plotting library (e.g., Matplotlib) to render the plot, which can then be returned as an image object or saved to a file.
  -->
- **Core Algorithms/Logic**: 
  <!-- TODO: Explain any complex algorithms or business logic central to the module. For example:
  The core logic involves mapping data columns to plot aesthetics (x-axis, y-axis, color, size, etc.) and calling the appropriate functions from the underlying plotting libraries. Error handling for invalid data formats or insufficient data for a chosen plot type is also a key aspect.
  -->
- **External Dependencies**: 
  <!-- TODO: List specific libraries or services it relies on and why. For example:
  - `matplotlib`: Core plotting library for 2D graphics.
  - `seaborn`: Higher-level interface for statistical graphics, built on Matplotlib.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and to handle input data structures (if DataFrames are a primary input).
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations, often a dependency of pandas and matplotlib.

## 3. Design Decisions and Rationale

<!-- TODO: Explain key design choices made during the development of this module and the reasons behind them. For example: -->

- **Choice of Matplotlib and Seaborn**: 
  <!-- TODO: Why was it selected over alternatives? For example:
  Matplotlib was chosen for its flexibility and widespread adoption, providing a solid foundation. Seaborn was added for its ease of use in creating common statistical plot types and for its aesthetically pleasing defaults. Alternatives like Plotly or Bokeh were considered but deemed potentially too heavy or complex for the initial requirements of simple, scriptable plots.
  -->
- **Handling Plot Customization**: 
  <!-- TODO: How does the current design address it? For example:
  The design aims for a balance between simplicity (predefined plot functions) and customization (allowing passthrough of common Matplotlib/Seaborn arguments like titles, labels, colors, etc., as detailed in the MCP Tool Specification).
  -->

## 4. Data Models

<!-- TODO: If the module works with significant data structures, describe them here. This might overlap with API specifications but can be more detailed from an internal perspective. For example:
The primary data models are the input structures expected by each plotting function. These are detailed in the `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` and generally involve:
- For X-Y plots (scatter, line): Lists or arrays for X and Y values.
- For bar charts: Lists for categories and corresponding values.
- For histograms: A single list or array of data.
- For heatmaps: A 2D array or matrix.
Pandas DataFrames might be an accepted input format for convenience, with column names used to specify data for different axes/attributes.
-->

- **Model `PlotInput` (Conceptual)**:
  - `data` (dict | pd.DataFrame): Containing series for x, y, categories, values, etc.
  - `plot_type` (str): e.g., 'scatter', 'line'.
  - `params` (dict): Plot-specific parameters like 'title', 'xlabel', 'ylabel', 'color_by', etc.

## 5. Configuration

<!-- TODO: Detail any advanced or internal configuration options not typically exposed in the main README or usage examples. How do these configurations affect the module's behavior?
For a visualization module, this might include:
- Default image resolution or output format (e.g., PNG, SVG).
- Default color palettes or style sheets.
These are likely set within the `plotter.py` or related configuration files.
-->

- `DEFAULT_DPI`: (e.g., 100, for plot resolution)
- `DEFAULT_FORMAT`: (e.g., 'png', for saved plot files)

## 6. Scalability and Performance

<!-- TODO: Discuss how the module is designed to scale and perform under load. Any known limitations or bottlenecks?
For example:
Performance is largely dependent on the size of the input data and the complexity of the plots generated by Matplotlib/Seaborn. For extremely large datasets, generating plots can be memory and CPU intensive. The module itself doesn't introduce significant overhead beyond the capabilities of these libraries. No specific distributed processing is implemented; it operates on a single-node basis per call.
-->

## 7. Security Aspects

<!-- TODO: Elaborate on security considerations specific to this module's design and implementation, beyond what's in the MCP tool spec if applicable.
For example:
Security risks are minimal for a data visualization module that primarily processes data and generates images.
- Input validation should sanitize any text inputs used for titles, labels, or filenames to prevent injection attacks if these are dynamically generated from less trusted sources (though this is less common for internal tools).
- Ensure that file saving operations are restricted to designated output directories and do not allow arbitrary path traversal.
The primary concern is resource exhaustion if very large datasets are processed, which should be handled by the calling environment or through input size limits.
-->

## 8. Future Development / Roadmap

<!-- TODO: Outline potential future enhancements or areas of development for this module. For example:
- Support for more plot types (e.g., 3D plots, network graphs).
- Interactive plot generation (e.g., using libraries like Bokeh or Plotly for web-based UIs).
- More sophisticated styling and theming options.
- Integration with a data storage backend for retrieving data to plot.
