# Code Execution Sandbox - Technical Overview

This document provides a detailed technical overview of the Code Execution Sandbox module.

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

<!-- TODO: Reiterate the module's core purpose from the main README.md, but with more technical depth. 
What specific problems does this module solve (e.g., secure execution of AI-generated code, running user-provided plugins, testing code snippets)? 
What are its key responsibilities (e.g., isolation, resource limiting, results reporting)? -->

## 2. Architecture

<!-- TODO: Describe the internal architecture of the module. This is CRITICAL for understanding its security.
Detail the chosen sandboxing technology (e.g., Docker, nsjail, Firecracker, gVisor, WebAssembly) and how it's leveraged.
Include a Mermaid diagram showing the flow from request to sandboxed execution and result retrieval. -->

- **Key Components/Sub-modules**: 
  <!-- TODO: Detail the main internal parts and their roles. Examples:
  - `SandboxManager`: Responsible for creating, configuring, and destroying sandbox instances (e.g., Docker containers).
  - `ExecutionOrchestrator`: Takes an `execute_code` MCP request, prepares the code and environment within the sandbox, runs the code, and collects results.
  - `ResourceLimiter`: Enforces CPU, memory, time, and potentially network/filesystem quotas using mechanisms of the chosen sandboxing tech.
  - `LanguageRuntimeProvider`: Manages the language environments within the sandbox (e.g., specific Docker images for Python 3.9, Node.js 18).
  - `ResultCollector`: Gathers stdout, stderr, exit code, and execution metrics from the sandbox.
  - `McpToolImplementations`: Concrete logic for the `execute_code` tool.
  -->
- **Data Flow**: <!-- TODO: Explain how data (code, stdin, language, timeout) flows into the sandbox, how results (stdout, stderr, exit_code, status) are collected and returned. Emphasize isolation boundaries. -->
- **Core Logic**: <!-- TODO: Explain logic for setting up cgroups, namespaces, seccomp filters, or other low-level isolation primitives if not fully abstracted by the chosen sandbox tech. How are language runtimes invoked securely? -->
- **External Dependencies**: <!-- TODO: List specific libraries (e.g., `docker` SDK for Python) or system tools (Docker daemon, `nsjail` binary) it directly relies on. -->

    C -- destroys --> D;
    B -- returns --> E[MCP Response: results];
```
<!-- TODO: Adapt the Mermaid diagram to accurately reflect the chosen sandboxing technology and interaction flow. -->

## 3. Design Decisions and Rationale

<!-- TODO: Explain key design choices, ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATED TO SECURITY. Examples:
- Choice of sandboxing technology (Docker vs. nsjail vs. gVisor etc.) and why (security properties, performance, ease of use, language support).
- Default resource limits and why they were chosen.
- Strategy for network isolation (default deny, specific proxy if allowed).
- Filesystem isolation strategy (ephemeral FS, read-only mounts, temporary writable areas).
- How language runtimes are provisioned and updated securely.
- Handling of potentially malicious code (e.g., fork bombs, infinite loops) through strict resource limits and monitoring.
-->

- **Choice of [Sandboxing Technology X]**: <!-- TODO: Justify selection based on security, performance, and operational criteria. -->
- **Handling [Resource Exhaustion Attack Y]**: <!-- TODO: How does the design mitigate this (e.g., ulimits, cgroups, timeout enforcement)? -->

## 4. Supported Languages and Runtimes

<!-- TODO: List the programming languages and specific versions explicitly supported by the sandbox. 
For each, briefly mention how the runtime environment is provided (e.g., specific Docker image, pre-installed binaries in a base sandbox image). 
Example:
- Python: 3.8 (debian:bullseye-slim base + Python install), 3.9 (python:3.9-slim image)
- JavaScript: Node.js 16.x (node:16-alpine image)
- C++: GCC 10.2 (custom Docker image with build-essential)
-->

## 5. Configuration

<!-- TODO: Detail CRITICAL configuration options related to security and resource management. 
Examples: Global max timeout, max memory, default CPU shares, path to Docker socket (if used), list of allowed language image tags. -->

- `GLOBAL_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME_SECONDS`: (Default: e.g., 300, Description: Absolute maximum timeout any execution request can specify.)
- `DEFAULT_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB`: (Default: e.g., 256, Description: Default memory limit for a sandbox instance if not otherwise specified for a language.)
- `ALLOWED_LANGUAGES_CONFIG_PATH`: (Default: e.g., "./sandbox_languages.json", Description: Path to a config file defining supported languages and their specific sandbox images/settings.)

## 6. Scalability and Performance

<!-- TODO: Discuss how the module handles concurrent execution requests. 
Consider sandbox startup overhead, potential for resource contention on the host, and strategies for pooling or reusing sandbox instances if applicable (though reuse has security implications). -->

## 7. Security Aspects (Module Internals)

<!-- TODO: This section MUST be detailed and specific to the sandbox implementation, supplementing the main SECURITY.md. 
    - **Isolation Guarantees & Limitations**: What does the chosen sandboxing technology protect against, and what are known bypasses or weaknesses to be aware of?
    - **Kernel Attack Surface**: If using containerization, how is the kernel attack surface minimized (e.g., seccomp, AppArmor/SELinux, user namespaces)?
    - **Secure Image/Runtime Management**: How are the language runtime environments (e.g., Docker images) built, scanned for vulnerabilities, and updated?
    - **Data Exfiltration Prevention**: Beyond network policies, are there other measures to prevent code from leaking data?
    - **Side-channel Attacks**: Are any side-channel attacks (e.g., timing, cache) considered, and if so, how?
    - **Logging & Auditing for Security**: What specific events are logged for security auditing purposes related to sandbox operations?
-->

## 8. Future Development / Roadmap

<!-- TODO: Outline potential future enhancements. 
Examples: Support for more languages, finer-grained resource controls, pluggable sandboxing backends, pre-warmed sandbox pools for lower latency. -->
