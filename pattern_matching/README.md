# Pattern Matching using cased/kit

This module focuses on identifying specific patterns within codebases. The `cased/kit` toolkit provides powerful features for various types of pattern matching.

## Capabilities

`cased/kit` enables pattern matching through:

1.  **Text and Regular Expression Search:**
    -   The `Repository.search_text()` method (or the `CodeSearcher` class) allows for fast and efficient searching of literal strings or regular expressions across files in a repository.
    -   This is useful for finding specific keywords, API usage, log messages, or known code anti-patterns.
    -   See `kit_text_search_example.py` for a demonstration.

2.  **Symbol Usage Search:**
    -   The `Repository.find_symbol_usages()` method helps locate where specific symbols (functions, classes, variables) are defined and referenced.
    -   This is a more structural form of pattern matching, useful for understanding how components are connected or identifying all instances of a particular function call.
    -   See `kit_symbol_search_example.py` for a demonstration.

3.  **Semantic Search (Advanced):**
    -   For more conceptual pattern matching (e.g., "find all places that handle user authentication"), `kit`'s semantic search capabilities (`Repository.search_semantic()` or `SummarySearcher`) can be used. This involves setting up vector embeddings.
    -   While not strictly "pattern" matching in the traditional sense, it allows finding code that matches a *concept* or *description*.

## Examples

-   `kit_text_search_example.py`: Demonstrates how to use `kit.Repository` (via `repo.get_code_searcher()`) for finding literal strings or regex patterns with context and other options.
-   `kit_symbol_search_example.py`: Shows how to use `kit.Repository.find_symbol_usages()` to trace where symbols are used.

These examples provide a starting point for leveraging `cased/kit` for pattern matching tasks within the Codomyrmex project.

## Key Components

(List and briefly describe the key sub-components, libraries, or tools utilized or developed within this module.)

- Component A: ...
- Component B: ...
- **`run_codomyrmex_analysis.py`**: The primary script in this module that orchestrates various analyses using `cased/kit` across the entire repository and its submodules. It generates reports on dependencies, text search results, code summaries, and docstring indexes.

## Integration Points

(Describe how this module interacts with other parts of the Codomyrmex system or external services.
- **Provides:**
    - Analysis reports and structured data (JSON files, text files, DOT graphs) about the codebase, saved to the `output/codomyrmex_analysis/` directory (configurable in the script).
- **Consumes:**
    - **`cased/kit` library**: Extensively used for all core analysis tasks (repository indexing, dependency analysis, text search, code summarization, docstring indexing).
    - **`logging_monitoring` module**: Uses `setup_logging()` and `get_logger()` for all logging within `run_codomyrmex_analysis.py`.
    - **`environment_setup.env_checker` module**: Uses `ensure_dependencies_installed()` to check for core project dependencies and `check_and_setup_env_vars()` to validate and guide `.env` file setup for API keys.
    - Environment variables (via `python-dotenv` loaded by `run_codomyrmex_analysis.py`) for API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) needed by `cased/kit`'s LLM-dependent features.
