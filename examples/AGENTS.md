# Codomyrmex Agents — examples

## Purpose
Legacy examples directory - examples have been migrated to `scripts/examples/` and `scripts/project_orchestration/examples/` for better organization.

## Active Components
- **Migration Status**: Examples have been reorganized into the `scripts/` directory structure
- **Output Directory**: Generated output files remain in `examples/output/` at the project root

## Operating Contracts
- Maintain alignment between code, documentation, and configured workflows.
- Ensure Model Context Protocol interfaces remain available for sibling agents.
- Record outcomes in shared telemetry and update TODO queues when necessary.
- Preserve backward compatibility for any remaining examples or output files.
