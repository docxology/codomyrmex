# Personal AI Infrastructure - Examples Context

**Directory**: `examples/`
**Status**: Active

## Overview

The `examples/` directory contains standalone, executable examples demonstrating the usage of various Codomyrmex modules. These are designed to be copied and adapted.

## AI Context

When working with examples:

1. **Reference, Not Production**: Examples are for learning. They may lack error handling for brevity.
2. **Execution**: Most examples can be run directly with `python examples/<name>.py` (with proper `PYTHONPATH`).
3. **Coverage Reports**: `coverage_report.json` tracks example execution coverage.
