    The rise of artificial intelligence in software development has created unprecedented opportunities 
    for automation and augmentation of human capabilities. However, it also presents challenges in terms 
    of integration complexity, tool proliferation, and maintaining human oversight in automated processes.
    
    Modern AI frameworks like GPT-4, Claude, and others provide powerful language processing capabilities,
    but they require careful orchestration to be effectively integrated into existing development workflows.
    This is where frameworks like Fabric and Codomyrmex become valuable - they provide structure and
    integration patterns that make AI adoption more manageable and effective.
