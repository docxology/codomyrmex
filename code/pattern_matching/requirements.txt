# Pattern Matching - Requirements

# This file lists Python packages and dependencies required for the Pattern Matching module.
# The `environment_setup/` module may use this file to provision the necessary environment.

# Core dependencies for this module (e.g., cased-kit) are expected to be in the root `requirements.txt`.

# LLM Provider SDKs (optional, if the module uses LLMs for analysis or pattern generation):
# Uncomment and pin the specific version if used.
# openai==1.79.0
# # anthropic==<version>
# # google-generativeai==<version>

# Other specific Python dependencies for this module should be listed here.
# For example, if using a specific AST parsing library not in standard Python:
# # ast-tools==X.Y.Z

# If all module-specific Python dependencies are covered by the root `requirements.txt`
# or standard Python libraries, this file can reflect that.
# Currently, this module primarily relies on `cased-kit` (from root) and standard libraries.

# PLEASE RENAME/ADAPT THIS FILE and its contents based on the primary language and package manager for this module.
# For example:
# - Python: `requirements.txt` (pip), `environment.yml` (conda), or `pyproject.toml` (poetry/pdm)
# - Node.js: `package.json`
# - Java: `pom.xml` (Maven), `build.gradle` (Gradle)
# - Go: `go.mod`
# - Rust: `Cargo.toml`
# - Ruby: `Gemfile`
# - etc.

# Example for a Python module (if this were `requirements.txt`):
# requests==2.25.1
# numpy>=1.20.0
# pandas # for latest version

# Example for a Node.js module (if this were `package.json`, content would be JSON):
# {
#   "name": "module-name",
#   "version": "0.1.0",
#   "dependencies": {
#     "library-a": "^1.2.3",
#     "library-b": "~4.5.6"
#   },
#   "devDependencies": {
#     "testing-framework": "^7.8.9"
#   }
# }

# Add your module-specific dependencies below, following the appropriate format for your chosen language/tooling.

# [Dependency Name]==[Version Specifier] # e.g., my-library==1.0.0
# [Another Dependency]>=[Minimum Version] # e.g., another-lib>=2.1

# This module currently uses dependencies from the root requirements.txt file.
# If this module develops specific Python dependencies not included globally,
# they should be listed here.
