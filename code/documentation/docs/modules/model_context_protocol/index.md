# Model Context Protocol

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) module defines and implements the standardized communication interface between the core Codomyrmex system (or an orchestrating AI agent) and various specialized tool-providing modules. It establishes the schema for tool invocation, parameter passing, and result/error reporting, enabling a plug-and-play architecture for Codomyrmex capabilities.

Its purpose is to:
- Standardize how tools are described and called.
- Facilitate the integration of new tools and modules.
- Provide a clear contract for AI agents to understand and utilize available functionalities.

## Key Components

- **Protocol Definition**: Formal specification of the JSON-based request and response schemas for tool interaction.
- **Tool Registry (Conceptual)**: A mechanism for discovering available tools and their specifications.
- **Dispatcher (Conceptual)**: A component that routes MCP requests to the appropriate module and tool.
- **Schema Validators**: Utilities to ensure MCP messages conform to the defined protocol.

## Integration Points

- **Provides**:
    - A defined protocol ([API Specification](./api_specification.md)) for how modules should expose their tools and how agents should call them.
    - Potentially, a central endpoint or library for agents to send MCP requests.
- **Consumes**:
    - Tool specifications from other modules (as defined in their respective `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` files).
    - MCP requests from AI agents or the core Codomyrmex orchestrator.
- Refer to the [API Specification](./api_specification.md) for the protocol details and the [MCP Tool Specification](./mcp_tool_specification.md) for how this module itself might expose meta-tools (e.g., for protocol validation or tool discovery).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Understanding of JSON and API concepts.
- Familiarity with the Codomyrmex module structure.

### For Tool Providers (Modules)

- Adhere to the MCP specification when defining tools in your module's `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`.
- Implement an interface within your module to receive and handle MCP requests for your tools.

### For Tool Consumers (AI Agents/Orchestrator)

- Format tool calls according to the MCP request schema.
- Be prepared to handle MCP responses, including success and error conditions.

## Development

### Code Structure

- `schemas/`: Contains JSON schemas defining the MCP request and response structures.
- `validators/`: Python scripts for validating MCP messages against the schemas.
- `core/` (Conceptual): Could contain dispatcher logic or a client library for interacting with MCP.
- For a more detailed architectural view, see the [Technical Overview](./docs/technical_overview.md).

### Building & Testing

- Tests would involve validating example MCP messages.
- Integration tests would check the end-to-end flow of an MCP request to a mock tool and back.
