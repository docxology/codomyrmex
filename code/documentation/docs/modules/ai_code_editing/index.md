# Ai Code Editing Module

## Overview

This module focuses on integrating AI-powered assistance directly into the developer workflow. It aims to leverage tools and techniques for AI-enhanced code editing, generation, and understanding.
Key technologies might include integrations with services like GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, or custom models via the Model Context Protocol.

## Key Components

(This section will be populated based on actual components developed. Example components could be:)
- **AI Prompt Library**: A collection of effective prompts for various coding tasks.
- **Context Builder**: Gathers relevant code context for AI models.
- **Editor Integration Service**: Provides an interface for IDEs/editors to communicate with the AI backend.

## Integration Points

- **Provides**:
    - AI-assisted code completion and generation services.
    - Code explanation and summarization features.
    - Interfaces for editors to request AI actions (potentially via [API Specification](./api_specification.md) or [MCP Tools](./mcp_tool_specification.md)).
- **Consumes**:
    - Code context from the active project.
    - User preferences and settings.
    - LLM services via the Model Context Protocol.
- Refer to the [API Specification](./api_specification.md) and [MCP Tool Specification](./mcp_tool_specification.md) for detailed programmatic interfaces.

## Getting Started

(This section to be detailed based on module implementation.)

### Prerequisites

- Potentially API keys for underlying LLM services.
- Configuration of the Model Context Protocol if used.

### Installation
