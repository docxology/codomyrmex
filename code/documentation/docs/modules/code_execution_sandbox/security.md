# Security Policy for Code Execution Sandbox Module

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability related to the sandbox implementation (e.g., a sandbox escape, insufficient resource limiting leading to DoS on the host), please report it immediately to `project-security@example.com`.

## Core Security Principle: Isolation

The primary security goal of this module is to provide strong isolation between executed code and the host system/Codomyrmex environment. All design and implementation choices must prioritize this principle.

## Key Security Measures & Considerations

- **Sandboxing Technology**: The choice of sandboxing technology (e.g., Docker with minimal base images, gVisor, Firecracker, nsjail, seccomp-bpf) is critical. It must be mature, well-understood, and configured for maximum isolation.
    - Docker: Use unprivileged containers, drop all capabilities, apply AppArmor/Seccomp profiles, use read-only root filesystems where possible, and employ minimal base images. No host volume mounts unless strictly necessary and heavily restricted.
    - VM-based (Firecracker): Offers stronger isolation but higher overhead.
- **Resource Limiting**: Strict enforcement of CPU time, execution wall-clock time, memory usage, disk space, and process count limits is essential to prevent DoS attacks.
- **Network Isolation**: By default, sandboxed code should have NO network access. If network access is required for specific use cases (e.g., installing packages, fetching data), it must be:
    - Explicitly enabled.
    - Restricted to a specific list of allowed hosts/IPs and ports.
    - Proxied if possible, to avoid direct network interface exposure to the sandbox.
- **Filesystem Access**: 
    - Sandboxed code should run in a temporary, ephemeral filesystem.
    - Input files should be securely copied into the sandbox.
    - Output files should be written to a designated, restricted output directory, and then copied out. No direct access to the host filesystem.
- **Least Privilege**: The process running the sandbox manager and the code within the sandbox should run with the absolute minimum privileges required.
- **Runtime Monitoring**: (Future) Monitor sandboxed processes for suspicious activity (e.g., unexpected syscalls, attempts to access restricted resources).
- **Language Runtimes**: Keep language runtimes and libraries used within sandbox images patched and up-to-date to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **Input/Output Sanitization**: While the sandbox contains the execution, be mindful of how inputs are passed and outputs are handled by the calling Codomyrmex modules, especially if outputs are displayed or further processed.

## Dependencies

The security of this module heavily relies on the security of the chosen sandboxing technology and the underlying operating system kernel. Keep these components updated with security patches.
