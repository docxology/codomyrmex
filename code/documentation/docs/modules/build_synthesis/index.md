# Build Synthesis Module

## Overview

This module is responsible for automating and managing the build processes for different components and modules within the Codomyrmex project. It aims to provide a unified way to define, execute, and monitor builds, potentially integrating with CI/CD systems and various build tools (e.g., Make, Gradle, Webpack, Docker Compose).

## Key Components

- **Build Script Generator**: May generate or template build scripts for common project types.
- **Dependency Manager Interface**: Interacts with dependency information to ensure builds are consistent.
- **Build Executor**: Orchestrates the execution of build commands for different tools.
- **Artifact Manager**: Handles build outputs (artifacts), potentially storing them or preparing them for deployment.

## Integration Points

- **Provides**:
    - A common interface or set of tools to trigger builds for any module.
    - Build status and artifact information.
    - See [API Specification](./api_specification.md) and [MCP Tool Specification](./mcp_tool_specification.md).
- **Consumes**:
    - Source code from modules.
    - Module-specific build configurations (e.g., `Makefile`, `package.json` scripts, `Dockerfile`).
    - Potentially, secrets or configurations for accessing artifact repositories.

## Getting Started

(Details on how to use this module to build other modules or the entire project.)

### Prerequisites

- Build tools relevant to the target modules (e.g., `make`, `npm`, `docker`, `python build tools`) must be available in the environment (managed by `environment_setup`).

### Configuration

- Defining build targets and steps.
- Configuring artifact storage locations.
