# Build Synthesis - Usage Examples

## Example 1: Building a Python Wheel for a Module

**Scenario**: You want to build a Python wheel artifact for the `data_visualization` module.

**Setup**:
- `data_visualization` module has a `pyproject.toml` and a build backend configured (e.g., `setuptools`, `poetry`).
- Python build tools are available.

**Invocation (conceptual MCP call `build_synthesis.start_module_build`):**
```json
{
  "tool_name": "build_synthesis.start_module_build",
  "arguments": {
    "module_name": "data_visualization",
    "build_target": "python_wheel", // Assuming this target is defined
    "clean_build": true
  }
}
```

### Expected Outcome

The Build Synthesis module orchestrates the `python -m build --wheel` command (or equivalent) for the `data_visualization` module. A `.whl` file is produced and its name might be returned in `artifacts_produced`.

**Example Output Snippet:**
```json
{
  "build_id": "build_xyz123",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "message": "Build for data_visualization (python_wheel) completed.",
  "artifacts_produced": ["data_visualization-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl"]
}
```

## Example 2: Building a Docker Image for a Service Module

**Scenario**: The `logging_monitoring` module contains a `Dockerfile` to package it as a service.

**Setup**:
- Docker is installed and running.
- `logging_monitoring` module has a `Dockerfile` at its root.

**Invocation (conceptual API call):**
```python
# Assuming a client library for the Build Synthesis API
build_client.trigger_build(
    module_name="logging_monitoring",
    build_target="docker_image",
    build_parameters={"image_tag": "latest"}
)
```

### Expected Outcome

A Docker image for the `logging_monitoring` module is built with the tag `logging_monitoring:latest` (or similar, depending on naming conventions defined in the Build Synthesis module).

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: Build fails due to missing dependencies in the build environment.
  - **Solution**: Ensure the `environment_setup` module correctly provisions all necessary build tools and system libraries for the build agents or the local environment.
- **Issue**: Inconsistent builds between local and CI environments.
  - **Solution**: Use containerized builds (e.g., via Docker) or ensure the CI build environment strictly mirrors the defined development environment. Pin versions of build tools.
- **Issue**: Build scripts are complex and hard to manage.
  - **Solution**: Leverage the Build Synthesis module to abstract common build patterns. Use templating for build scripts where possible.
