# Pattern Matching Documentation - Remaining Tasks

This document tracks the remaining documentation tasks for the Pattern Matching module. It is for internal use and should be removed once all tasks are complete.

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Created basic directory structure in `documentation/docs/modules/pattern_matching/`
- ✅ Added the Pattern Matching module to `sidebars.js`
- ✅ Created module index file (`pattern-matching-index.md`)
- ✅ Created module documentation index (`docs/pattern-matching-module-docs-index.md`)
- ✅ Created tutorials index (`docs/tutorials/pattern-matching-tutorials-index.md`)
- ✅ Created example tutorial (`docs/tutorials/pattern-matching-example-tutorial.md`)
- ✅ Created technical overview (`docs/pattern-matching-technical-overview.md`)
- ✅ Created API specification (`pattern-matching-api-specification.md`)
- ✅ Created MCP tool specification (`pattern-matching-mcp-tool-specification.md`)
- ✅ Created usage examples (`pattern-matching-usage-examples.md`)
- ✅ Created changelog (`pattern-matching-changelog.md`)
- ✅ Created security policy (`pattern-matching-security.md`)
- ✅ Updated TO-DO.md to reflect progress

## Remaining Tasks

- ⏳ Verify all links in documentation files work correctly
- ⏳ Ensure content is synchronized with actual module implementation
- ⏳ Add screenshots or diagrams to enhance documentation
- ⏳ Expand the example tutorial with more real-world examples
- ⏳ Conduct a peer review of documentation for clarity and accuracy
- ⏳ Test the documentation build process to ensure proper rendering

## Next Steps

1. Proceed with similar documentation improvements for other modules
2. Focus on modules that already have significant implementation progress
3. Implement consistent contact information and response times across security documents
4. Develop a plan for continuous documentation updates as the codebase evolves
