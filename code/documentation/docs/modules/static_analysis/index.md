# Static Analysis Module

## Overview

This module centralizes tools and processes for static analysis of code within the Codomyrmex ecosystem. It aims to help developers maintain code quality, identify potential bugs, enforce coding standards, and scan for security vulnerabilities *before* runtime. It can integrate with various linters, formatters, and security analysis tools for multiple languages.

## Key Components

(This section will be populated based on actual components developed. Examples:)
- **Linter Gateway**: An interface to run various linters (e.g., ESLint, Pylint, Checkstyle) against codebases.
- **Security Scanner**: Integrates tools like CodeQL, SonarQube (community edition if applicable), or Bandit to identify security flaws.
- **Quality Metrics Aggregator**: Collects metrics like cyclomatic complexity, code coverage (from other tools), and maintainability scores.
- **Configuration Manager**: Manages configurations for different static analysis tools, allowing project-specific or global settings.

## Integration Points

- **Provides**:
    - Reports on code quality, bugs, and vulnerabilities.
    - Automated code formatting services.
    - APIs/Tools for triggering analysis runs (see [API Specification](./api_specification.md) and [MCP Tool Specification](./mcp_tool_specification.md)).
- **Consumes**:
    - Source code from various modules or the entire project.
    - Configuration files for linters and other tools.
- Refer to the [API Specification](./api_specification.md) and [MCP Tool Specification](./mcp_tool_specification.md) for detailed programmatic interfaces.

## Getting Started

(Details to be added based on implementation.)

### Prerequisites

- The specific static analysis tools (e.g., linters for target languages) might need to be installed in the environment. The `environment_setup` module should handle this.
- For some tools like SonarQube, a running instance might be required.

### Installation

(Details on installing or enabling this specific module and its dependencies.)

### Configuration

- Configuring which linters/tools to run for specific languages or file types.
- Setting up rule sets for linters (e.g., `.eslintrc.js`, `pyproject.toml` for Pylint).
- Pointing to external analysis services if used (e.g., SonarQube server URL).

## Development

### Code Structure

(Briefly describe the organization of code within the `static_analysis` module. For a more detailed architectural view, see the [Technical Overview](./docs/technical_overview.md).)

### Building & Testing

(Instructions for building and running tests for this module, typically found in `static_analysis/tests/README.md`.)
