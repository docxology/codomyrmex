# Data Visualization

## Overview

The Data Visualization module offers a suite of tools and functions for generating various types of plots and visual representations of data within the Codomyrmex project. Its primary goal is to help users and developers understand complex datasets, analyze trends, debug algorithms, and communicate results effectively through clear and informative graphics. It supports common plot types such as line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and potentially more specialized visualizations.

## Key Components

- **Plotting Functions**: A collection of Python functions for generating specific plot types, such as:
    - `create_heatmap()`: For generating heatmaps.
    - `create_line_plot()`: For creating line plots.
    - `create_scatter_plot()`: For generating scatter plots.
    - `create_bar_chart()`: For creating bar charts.
    - `create_histogram()`: For generating histograms.
    - `create_pie_chart()`: For creating pie charts.
- **Core Plotting Libraries**: Primarily utilizes `matplotlib` and `seaborn` as the backend for plot generation.
- **Output Management**: Functionality to save plots to various file formats (e.g., PNG, SVG) and to display plots interactively where appropriate.
- **Customization Options**: Parameters within plotting functions to customize titles, labels, colors, sizes, and other visual aspects.

## Integration Points

This module enables visual understanding of data and integrates as follows:

- **Provides:**
    - **Plotting Functions**: A Python API (e.g., `plotter.py`) for generating various visualizations like heatmaps, line plots, scatter plots, etc.
    - **Image Files**: Outputs generated plots as image files (e.g., PNG, SVG) to specified paths, often within the `output/data_visualization/` directory.
    - **MCP Tools**: Exposes plotting functionalities as tools (e.g., `create_heatmap`, `create_line_plot`) via the Model Context Protocol, allowing AI agents to request visualizations. (See `mcp_tool_specification.md` for details).

- **Consumes:**
    - **Data Sources**: Numerical data (e.g., Python lists, NumPy arrays, Pandas DataFrames) provided by other modules, user scripts, or loaded from files, which serve as input for visualizations.
    - **`logging_monitoring` module**: For logging activities, warnings (e.g., invalid data for plotting), and errors during plot generation.
    - **`environment_setup` module**: May use utilities from this module to check for necessary dependencies like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` if not managed at the project level.
    - **`model_context_protocol` module**: Adheres to MCP standards for defining its exposed plotting tools.
    - **Configuration**: Potentially consumes configuration for default styling, output directories, or themes.
