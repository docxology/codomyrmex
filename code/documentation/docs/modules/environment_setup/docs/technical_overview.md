# Environment Setup Module - Technical Overview

This document provides a detailed technical overview of the components within the Environment Setup module itself.

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The `environment_setup` module centralizes instructions and supporting scripts for preparing a development environment capable of running and contributing to all parts of the Codomyrmex project. Its primary responsibilities are:
- Providing clear, step-by-step instructions for setting up Python, Node.js, Git, and other essential tools.
- Offering guidance on managing dependencies for both the Python backend and the Docusaurus frontend.
- Potentially housing utility scripts (e.g., `env_checker.py`) to help developers verify their setup.

## 2. Architecture

This module is primarily documentation-driven, but may include utility scripts.

- **Key Components/Sub-modules**:
  - `README.md` (and its Docusaurus counterpart `documentation/docs/modules/environment_setup/index.md` and `documentation/docs/development/environment-setup.md`): The main instructional document.
  - `env_checker.py` (Conceptual): A Python script intended to verify the presence and versions of required software (Python, Node, Git, etc.) and key dependencies. It would use standard library functions (`sys`, `subprocess`, `importlib.metadata`) to perform checks.
  - `requirements.txt` (in module root, if any specific Python tools for this module were needed, distinct from project root `requirements.txt`). Currently, this module primarily points to project-level requirements.

- **Data Flow** (for `env_checker.py`):
  1. User executes `python environment_setup/env_checker.py`.
  2. Script runs a series of predefined checks (e.g., `subprocess.run(["python", "--version"], capture_output=True)`).
  3. Results of checks are formatted and printed to standard output.
  4. Script exits with a status code indicating overall success/failure.

- **Core Algorithms/Logic** (for `env_checker.py`):
  - Version parsing for tools like Python, Node.
  - Checking for command existence in PATH.
  - Verifying Python package installation and versions.

- **External Dependencies** (for the module itself, not the environment it sets up):
  - Python standard library (for `env_checker.py`).

```

## 3. Design Decisions and Rationale

- **Centralized Setup Instructions**: Keeping all primary setup information in one module (`environment_setup`) and a single Docusaurus page (`development/environment-setup.md`) makes it easier for new developers to get started.
- **Conceptual `env_checker.py`**: While not fully implemented, designing such a script provides a clear path for future automation of environment validation, reducing setup friction.
- **Separate Python and Node.js Instructions**: Clearly delineating the setup for the Python backend components and the Node.js/Docusaurus frontend helps manage complexity.

## 4. Data Models

N/A for direct data models within this module, as it primarily provides instructions and scripts that report status.

## 5. Configuration

- The `env_checker.py` script could potentially take command-line arguments to specify which parts of the environment to check (e.g., `--check-python-only`, `--check-docs-only`).

## 6. Scalability and Performance

- The `env_checker.py` script is expected to be lightweight and run quickly.
- The documentation itself is static and performs well.

## 7. Security Aspects

- If `env_checker.py` or similar scripts execute external commands, they must do so safely, avoiding shell injection vulnerabilities (e.g., by not constructing commands from unvalidated user input).
- Instructions should always point to official download sources for tools.

## 8. Future Development / Roadmap

- Fully implement and refine `env_checker.py` with comprehensive checks for all critical dependencies and tools.
- Add options to `env_checker.py` to attempt automatic installation of missing minor dependencies (e.g., specific Python packages) if feasible and desired.
- Provide more detailed troubleshooting tips for common setup issues based on user feedback.
- Potentially create different setup profiles or scripts for minimal setup vs. full development setup (including all optional tools).
