# Git Operations

## Overview

This module provides tools and utilities for interacting with Git repositories. It aims to encapsulate common Git commands and workflows, making them accessible programmatically for other Codomyrmex modules or for automation tasks. This could include functionalities like cloning repositories, checking status, staging changes, committing, branching, merging, and fetching/pushing updates.

## Key Components

- Wrappers around standard Git CLI commands.
- Python libraries (e.g., `GitPython`) for more complex Git interactions.
- Functions to parse Git output and provide structured data.

## Integration Points

- **Provides:** A set of functions or MCP tools for performing Git actions.
- **Consumes:** May take repository paths, commit messages, branch names, etc., as input.
- Refer to the [API Specification](./api_specification.md) and [MCP Tool Specification](./mcp_tool_specification.md) for detailed programmatic interfaces.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git must be installed on the system and accessible in the PATH.
- For Python-based interactions, relevant Python libraries might need to be installed (e.g., `GitPython`, which should be in the main `requirements.txt`).

### Installation

This module is part of the Codomyrmex project. Ensure the main project is set up as per the [Environment Setup documentation](../environment_setup/index.md).

### Configuration

- Git user name and email should be configured globally or per-repository for commit operations.
- Authentication for remote repositories (e.g., SSH keys, HTTPS credentials) must be handled by the system's Git configuration.

## Development

### Code Structure

(Code would typically be organized into utility functions, potentially a class wrapping Git functionalities, and MCP tool definitions. For a more detailed architectural view, see the [Technical Overview](./docs/technical_overview.md).)

### Building & Testing

(Tests would involve creating temporary Git repositories, performing operations, and verifying the state or output.)
