# Git Operations - Tutorial: Basic Git Interactions (Conceptual)

This tutorial will guide you through conceptually using the Git Operations module to perform basic Git tasks like cloning a repository and checking its status.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An understanding of what Git is and basic Git concepts (repository, clone, commit, status).
- The Codomyrmex environment set up. While this tutorial is conceptual, in a real scenario, the Git Operations module and Git itself would need to be functional.
- Access to a publicly available Git repository URL for the cloning example (e.g., one on GitHub).

## 2. Goal

By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how one might conceptually:

- Use a function or tool from the Git Operations module to clone a remote repository.
- Use a function or tool to check the status of a local repository.

## 3. Steps

### Step 1: Define Repository Information for Cloning

First, identify the repository you want to clone and decide on a local path for it.

- **Remote Repository URL**: e.g., `https://github.com/Codomyrmex/codomyrmex.git` (using the project itself as an example)
- **Desired Local Path**: e.g., `./temp_clone_dir/codomyrmex_project`

### Step 2: Conceptual Invocation - Cloning

Imagine you have a Python function `git_clone(repo_url, local_path)` from the module, or an MCP tool `git_clone_repository`.

**Conceptual Python Usage:**

```python
# from codomyrmex.git_operations import git_clone # Conceptual import

repo_to_clone = "https://github.com/Codomyrmex/codomyrmex.git"
path_to_clone_to = "./temp_clone_dir/codomyrmex_project"

print(f"Attempting to clone {repo_to_clone} to {path_to_clone_to}...")
# success = git_clone(repo_to_clone, path_to_clone_to) # Conceptual call
success = True # Placeholder for tutorial flow

if success:
    print("Repository cloned successfully (conceptually).")
else:
    print("Cloning failed (conceptually).")
```

**Conceptual MCP Tool Invocation:**

```json
// This would be part of a larger MCP request
{
  "tool_name": "git_clone_repository",
  "arguments": {
    "repository_url": "https://github.com/Codomyrmex/codomyrmex.git",
    "local_path": "./temp_clone_dir/codomyrmex_project"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Verify the (Conceptual) Output of Cloning

- In a real scenario, you would check if the directory `./temp_clone_dir/codomyrmex_project` was created and populated with the repository files.
- The function/tool should return a success status.

### Step 4: Conceptual Invocation - Checking Status

Now, let's assume the repository was cloned. We want to check its status using a conceptual function `git_status(repo_path)` or an MCP tool `git_get_status`.

**Conceptual Python Usage:**

```python
# from codomyrmex.git_operations import git_status # Conceptual import

local_repo_path = "./temp_clone_dir/codomyrmex_project"

print(f"Attempting to get status for {local_repo_path}...")
# status_info = git_status(local_repo_path) # Conceptual call
status_info = { # Placeholder for tutorial flow
    "branch": "main", 
    "is_dirty": False, 
    "untracked_files": [], 
    "modified_files": [], 
    "staged_files": [] 
} 

if status_info:
    print(f"Status: Branch - {status_info.get('branch')}, Dirty - {status_info.get('is_dirty')}")
    # Potentially print more details like file lists
else:
    print("Failed to get repository status (conceptually).")
```

### Step 5: Understand the (Conceptual) Status Output

- The `status_info` dictionary (or similar object) would provide information like:
    - Current branch name.
    - A boolean indicating if there are uncommitted changes (`is_dirty`).
    - Lists of untracked, modified, or staged files.
- For a freshly cloned repository, it should typically be on the default branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and not be dirty.

## 4. Understanding the Results

This tutorial conceptually walked through using the Git Operations module for two fundamental tasks:
- Fetching a complete repository from a remote source to your local machine.
- Inspecting the state of a local repository to understand its current branch and any pending changes.

These operations are foundational for many development workflows and automation tasks involving source code.

## 5. Troubleshooting (Conceptual)

- **Error: Cloning Fails (e.g., "Repository not found" or "Authentication failed")**
  - **Cause**: Invalid URL, private repository without proper credentials configured in the environment, network issues.
  - **Solution**: Verify the URL. For private repos, ensure SSH keys or HTTPS credentials are set up correctly for Git on the system running the module.
- **Error: Status Check Fails (e.g., "Not a Git repository")**
  - **Cause**: The provided path for the status check is not the root of a Git working directory (i.e., it doesn't contain a `.git` folder).
  - **Solution**: Ensure the path points to the correct directory where the repository was cloned.

## 6. Next Steps

Congratulations on conceptually completing this tutorial!

Now you can imagine exploring other conceptual features:
- Programmatically staging changes and committing them.
- Creating and switching branches.
- Pushing changes to a remote repository.
- Consulting the [API Specification](../../api_specification.md) and [MCP Tool Specification](../../mcp_tool_specification.md) for more details on available operations.
