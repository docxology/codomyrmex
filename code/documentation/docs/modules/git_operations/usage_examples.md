# Git Operations - Usage Examples

This section provides examples of how the conceptual functions or tools from the Git Operations module might be used.

## Example 1: Cloning a Repository

This example demonstrates using a conceptual `git_clone` function (as described in the [API Specification](./api_specification.md)) or an MCP tool `git_clone_repository` (as in [MCP Tool Specification](./mcp_tool_specification.md)).

**Conceptual Python Usage:**

```python
# Assuming a Python function `git_clone` exists in the module:
# from codomyrmex.git_operations import git_clone

repo_url = "https://github.com/someuser/somerepo.git"
local_clone_path = "./cloned_repos/somerepo"

try:
    if git_clone(repo_url, local_clone_path):
        print(f"Repository cloned successfully to {local_clone_path}")
    else:
        print("Cloning failed.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

**Conceptual MCP Tool Invocation:**

```json
{
  "tool_name": "git_clone_repository",
  "arguments": {
    "repository_url": "https://github.com/someuser/somerepo.git",
    "local_path": "./cloned_repos/somerepo"
  }
}
```

### Expected Outcome

- The specified repository (`https://github.com/someuser/somerepo.git`) is cloned into the `./cloned_repos/somerepo` directory relative to where the script or tool is executed.
- A success message is printed, or an error is reported if cloning fails (e.g., repository not found, path already exists and is not empty, network issues).

## Example 2: Getting Repository Status

This example shows how to use a conceptual `git_status` function.

**Conceptual Python Usage:**

```python
# Assuming a Python function `git_status` exists:
# from codomyrmex.git_operations import git_status

repo_path = "./cloned_repos/somerepo" # Path to an existing local repository

try:
    status = git_status(repo_path)
    print(f"Status for {repo_path}:")
    print(f"  Branch: {status.get('branch')}")
    print(f"  Is Dirty: {status.get('is_dirty')}")
    print(f"  Untracked Files: {status.get('untracked_files')}")
    print(f"  Modified Files: {status.get('modified_files')}")
    print(f"  Staged Files: {status.get('staged_files')}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while getting status for {repo_path}: {e}")
```

### Expected Outcome

- The script prints the current Git status of the repository at `./cloned_repos/somerepo`.
- This includes the current branch, whether there are uncommitted changes (dirty status), and lists of untracked, modified, and staged files.
- If the path is not a Git repository or another error occurs, an error message is printed.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: Authentication errors when cloning/pushing/pulling private repositories.
  - **Solution**: Ensure your Git environment is correctly configured for authentication (e.g., SSH keys added to your agent, HTTPS credentials configured with a credential helper). The Git Operations module typically relies on the underlying system's Git configuration for authentication.
- **Issue**: `GitCommandError` or similar when a Git command fails.
  - **Solution**: Check the error message details. It might indicate a problem with the repository path, network connectivity, or an invalid Git state for the attempted operation (e.g., trying to commit with nothing staged).
- **Issue**: `NotAGitRepositoryError`.
  - **Solution**: Ensure the path provided to functions like `git_status` points to a valid Git repository (i.e., a directory containing a `.git` subdirectory).
- **Issue**: Tool or function cannot find the `git` executable.
  - **Solution**: Ensure Git is installed and that the `git` command is available in the system's PATH environment variable for the process running the Codomyrmex module.
