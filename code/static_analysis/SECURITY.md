# Security Policy for Static Analysis

This document outlines security procedures and policies for the Static Analysis module.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this module, please report it to us as soon as possible.
We take all security reports seriously.

**DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please email blanket@activeinference.institute with the subject line: "SECURITY Vulnerability Report: Static Analysis - [Brief Description]".

Please include the following information in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any specific configurations or conditions required.
- Any proof-of-concept code or examples.
- The version(s) of the module affected.
- Your name and contact information (optional).

We aim to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 2-3 business days and will work with you to understand and remediate the issue. We may request additional information if needed.

Public disclosure of the vulnerability will be coordinated with you after the vulnerability has been fixed and an update is available, or after a reasonable period if a fix is not immediately possible.

## Security Updates

Security patches and updates for this module will be documented in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) and released as part of regular version updates. Critical vulnerabilities may warrant out-of-band releases.

## Scope

This security policy applies only to the `Static Analysis` module within the Codomyrmex project. For project-wide security concerns, please refer to the main project's security policy (if available) or contact the core project maintainers.

## Best Practices for Using This Module

- Always use the latest stable version of this module and all underlying static analysis tools (Pylint, Flake8, Bandit, Pyrefly, etc.).
- **Tool Security**: Be aware that static analysis tools themselves can have vulnerabilities. Keep them updated from official sources. If a tool processes configuration files (e.g., `.pylintrc`, `pyproject.toml`), ensure these configurations are secure and not sourced from untrusted locations if they can influence tool behavior dangerously (e.g., loading arbitrary plugins).
- **Input Code Security**: Static analysis tools parse and analyze source code. While they don't execute it, malformed or maliciously crafted code could potentially find vulnerabilities in the parsers or checkers of these tools, leading to excessive resource consumption or crashes.
- **Secure Configuration**: Ensure that configuration files for the analysis tools (e.g., `.pylintrc`, `pyproject.toml` sections for Flake8, Bandit, Pyrefly) are secure. Avoid configurations that might load untrusted plugins or execute arbitrary code during analysis, if such features exist in the tools.
- **Output Handling**: The output from static analysis tools (lists of issues, code snippets) might reveal information about the analyzed code's structure or potential vulnerabilities. Handle this output securely, especially if it's stored or displayed.
- **Resource Consumption**: Running multiple static analysis tools, especially on large codebases or with complex checks enabled, can be resource-intensive (CPU, memory). Configure analysis appropriately for the environment.
- **Dependency Security**: Ensure that Python and any libraries used by this module or the static analysis tools are kept up to date.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring access or permissions related to this module.
- Regularly review configurations for the static analysis tools and logs from this module for suspicious activity.

Thank you for helping keep Codomyrmex and the Static Analysis module secure.
