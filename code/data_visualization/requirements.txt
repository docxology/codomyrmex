# Data Visualization - Module-Specific Requirements

# This module relies on the following primary Python libraries for its functionality.
# These versions are pinned for stability and reproducibility.
numpy==2.2.6
matplotlib==3.10.3
seaborn==0.13.2

# This module may also utilize common libraries from the root `requirements.txt`
# such as `python-dotenv` if configuration loading is needed directly within
# visualization scripts or utilities specific to this module.

# If this module later requires other specific dependencies not included globally
# or in the list above, they should be added here with pinned versions.

# No additional dependencies currently required
