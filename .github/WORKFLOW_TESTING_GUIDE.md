# 🧪 GitHub Actions Workflow Testing Guide

## Testing Overview

This guide outlines how to test all GitHub Actions workflows to ensure they function correctly after the comprehensive improvements made.

## 🚦 Pre-Testing Checklist

### Repository Setup
- [ ] ✅ **Workflows committed** - All improved workflows are in main branch
- [ ] 🔐 **Secrets configured** - Required repository secrets are set
- [ ] 📚 **GitHub Pages enabled** - For documentation deployment
- [ ] 🛡️ **Security tab enabled** - For SARIF uploads
- [ ] ⚡ **Actions enabled** - Workflow permissions configured

### Required Secrets
```bash
# Repository Secrets Needed:
CODECOV_TOKEN=<your_codecov_token>        # Optional but recommended
SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=<your_semgrep_token>    # Optional for enhanced security
# GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically provided
```

## 🎯 Testing Strategy

### 1. **Automated Testing (Recommended)**
The workflows are designed to test themselves through the **Workflow Coordinator**:

```bash
# Trigger comprehensive testing
gh workflow run workflow-coordinator.yml -f workflows=all
```

### 2. **Manual Testing by Workflow**
Test each workflow individually:

```bash
# Test individual workflows
gh workflow run ci.yml
gh workflow run security.yml  
gh workflow run documentation.yml
gh workflow run benchmarks.yml
```

### 3. **Event-Based Testing**
Test workflows through natural triggers:

## 📋 Detailed Testing Plan

### A. **CI Pipeline Testing (`ci.yml`)**

#### Trigger Methods:
1. **Push to main/develop**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-ci-workflow
   echo "# Test change" >> README.md
   git add . && git commit -m "test: trigger CI workflow"
   git push origin test-ci-workflow
   # Create PR to main
   ```

2. **Manual trigger**:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run ci.yml
   ```

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Ruff, Black, MyPy, Pylint checks pass
- ✅ **Security**: Bandit scan completes
- ✅ **Complexity**: Radon and Lizard analysis
- ✅ **Tests**: Multi-OS/Python matrix execution

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

#### Expected Results:

1. **Dependency changes**:
   ```bash
   echo "requests>=2.25.0" >> requirements.txt
   git add . && git commit -m "test: trigger security scan"
   git push
   ```

2. **Manual/Scheduled**:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run security.yml
   ```

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ **Dependency scan**: pip-audit and safety checks

```

### D. **Documentation Testing (`documentation.yml`)**

#### Trigger Methods:
1. **Documentation changes**:
   ```bash
   echo "## Test Update" >> README.md
   git add . && git commit -m "docs: test documentation workflow"
   git push
   ```

2. **Manual trigger**:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run documentation.yml
   ```

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ **Structure validation**: Required files checked
- ✅ **Documentation aggregation**: Module docs collected
- ✅ **Website build**: Docusaurus/static site generation
- ✅ **Link checking**: Internal and external links verified
- ✅ **GitHub Pages deployment**: Site deployed (on main branch)
- ✅ **PR preview**: Preview deployment for PRs

#### Success Indicators:
```
✅ Validation: Passed
✅ Aggregation: Passed
✅ Build: Passed  
✅ Link Check: Completed
✅ Deployment: Success (main branch)
```

### E. **Workflow Coordination Testing (`workflow-coordinator.yml`)**

#### Trigger Methods:
1. **Smart triggering**:
   ```bash
   # Make source changes
   echo "print('test')" >> src/codomyrmex/__init__.py
   git add . && git commit -m "test: trigger smart coordination"
   git push
   ```

2. **Manual with specific workflows**:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run workflow-coordinator.yml -f workflows=ci,security,docs
   ```

#### Expected Results:

Overall Health: 10/10 workflows successful (100.0%)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "UV version not found"
**Solution**: Update `UV_VERSION` in workflow files
```yaml
env:
  UV_VERSION: "0.5.7"  # Use latest version
```

#### Issue: "SARIF upload failed"
**Solution**: Check repository security settings
```bash
# Ensure Security tab is enabled in repository settings
# SARIF uploads require security-events: write permission
```

#### Issue: "Codecov upload failed"
**Solution**: Check CODECOV_TOKEN secret
```bash
gh secret set CODECOV_TOKEN --body="your-codecov-token"
```

#### Issue: "Documentation build failed"
**Solution**: Check Node.js and dependency installation
```yaml
# Ensure Node.js version is correct
node-version: '20'
```

#### Issue: "Pre-commit hook timeout"
**Solution**: Check pre-commit configuration
```bash
# Verify .pre-commit-config.yaml exists or gets generated
```

### Debugging Commands

#### View workflow runs:
```bash
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --limit=5
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

#### Check workflow files:
```bash
gh workflow list
gh workflow view ci.yml
```

#### Monitor real-time:
```bash
gh run watch
```
