# Environment Setup - MCP Tool Specification

This document outlines the specification for tools within the Environment Setup module that are intended to be integrated with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Currently, the Environment Setup module does not expose any functionalities as MCP tools.

Its primary purpose is to provide scripts and checks (e.g., `env_checker.py`) for setting up and validating the development environment. These are typically invoked directly by developers or CI/CD pipelines, not by an LLM or AI agent via MCP.

If, in the future, specific environment setup tasks are identified as beneficial to be exposed as MCP tools (e.g., a tool to report on the current environment status in a structured way for an agent), this document will be updated to define their specifications.

For now, this specification is N/A (Not Applicable).
