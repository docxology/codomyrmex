# Environment Setup - Technical Overview

This document provides a detailed technical overview of the Environment Setup module.

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

<!-- TODO: Reiterate the module's core purpose from the main README, but with more technical depth. For example:
The Environment Setup module is designed to streamline the initial developer onboarding process and ensure a consistent, verifiable development environment for the Codomyrmex project. It primarily achieves this through the `env_checker.py` script, which validates critical Python dependencies and guides the setup of essential configurations like API keys via `.env` files. Its key responsibility is to minimize environment-related issues and provide a baseline for all other development activities.
-->

## 2. Architecture

<!-- TODO: Describe the internal architecture of the module. For example:
The module's architecture is centered around the `env_checker.py` script. This script contains standalone functions that perform specific checks.
-->

- **Key Components/Sub-modules**:
  - `env_checker.py`:
    - `ensure_dependencies_installed()`: Function to check for the presence of core Python packages (e.g., `kit`, `dotenv`) by attempting to import them. Provides instructional output if missing.
    - `check_and_setup_env_vars(repo_root_path: str)`: Function to verify the existence of a `.env` file at the project root. Guides users in creating one with placeholders for API keys if it's missing.
    - `if __name__ == '__main__':` block: Allows `env_checker.py` to be run as a standalone script to perform both checks.
- **Data Flow**: 
  <!-- TODO: How does data move through the module? For example:
  - `ensure_dependencies_installed()`: No external data input; relies on Python's import mechanism. Outputs messages to `stderr` and can terminate the script.
  - `check_and_setup_env_vars()`: Takes `repo_root_path` (string) as input. Reads file system to check for `.env`. Outputs messages to `stdout/stderr` and can terminate. If `.env` exists, `dotenv.load_dotenv()` is called, modifying the current process's environment variables.
  -->
- **Core Algorithms/Logic**: 
  <!-- TODO: Explain any complex algorithms or business logic central to the module. For example:
  - Dependency checking: Simple `try-except ImportError` blocks.
  - `.env` file check: `os.path.exists()` and guidance print statements.
  - Project root determination in `__main__`: Uses `os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..'))` assuming `env_checker.py` is in `environment_setup/` under the project root.
  -->
- **External Dependencies** (for `env_checker.py` operation, not what it checks for):
  - `sys`: For `sys.exit()` and `sys.stderr`.
  - `os`: For path manipulation (`os.path.exists`, `os.path.join`, `os.path.abspath`, `os.path.dirname`).
  - (Indirectly) `importlib` (used by `import` statements).
  - (Indirectly) `dotenv` library (it calls `dotenv.load_dotenv()` but the check is for its presence).

<!-- A Mermaid diagram might be overly complex for this simple module, but one could show the __main__ block calling the two functions. -->

## 3. Design Decisions and Rationale

<!-- TODO: Explain key design choices. For example: -->

- **Choice of Standalone Script (`env_checker.py`) with Importable Functions**: 
  <!-- TODO: Why was it selected over alternatives? For example:
  This provides flexibility. Developers can quickly run `python environment_setup/env_checker.py` for a full check. Other scripts or modules can also import and use the specific checking functions programmatically as preconditions.
  -->
- **Error Handling via `sys.exit(1)`**: 
  <!-- TODO: How does the current design address it? For example:
  For critical missing pieces (dependencies, `.env` file after guidance), the script exits with a non-zero code. This is suitable for CI/CD pipelines or scripts that need to halt on environment failure. Instructional messages are printed before exiting.
  -->
- **Reliance on Root `requirements.txt`**: 
  <!-- TODO: Explain this choice. For example:
The module itself does not have its own extensive list of unique dependencies; it primarily checks for dependencies crucial for the whole project, which are expected to be in the root `requirements.txt`.
  -->

## 4. Data Models

<!-- TODO: If the module works with significant data structures... For example:
N/A. The module primarily deals with system checks and string paths, not complex data structures.
-->
N/A

## 5. Configuration

<!-- TODO: Detail any advanced or internal configuration options... For example:
N/A. The `env_checker.py` script itself is not configured. It checks for configurations (like `.env` files) needed by other parts of the project.
-->
N/A

## 6. Scalability and Performance

<!-- TODO: Discuss scalability and performance... For example:
N/A for this type of utility module. The checks performed are quick local operations.
-->
N/A

## 7. Security Aspects

<!-- TODO: Elaborate on security considerations... For example:
- The primary security consideration is guiding users to create `.env` files and emphasizing that these should **not** be committed to version control. The `env_checker.py` script prints guidance but does not create or manage the content of API keys itself.
- The script executes Python's `import` statements. It assumes the Python environment and the packages being imported (like `kit`, `dotenv`) are from trusted sources (as per the project's dependency management practices).
- See `SECURITY.md` for more on handling API keys.
-->

## 8. Future Development / Roadmap

<!-- TODO: Outline potential future enhancements... For example:
- More comprehensive dependency checks (e.g., specific versions, system-level tools beyond Python packages).
- Interactive mode for creating `.env` file.
- Integration with project initialization scripts (e.g., a `make setup` target).
- Checking for Node.js, npm/yarn if not already covered by a different mechanism for the `documentation` module.
