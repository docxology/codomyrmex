# Claude Code Skills → Antigravity IDE Crossover Index

All 32 Claude Code plugins and their SKILL.md paths. **Antigravity can read any skill on demand with `view_file`.**

## Workflow Bridges (Auto-Loaded)

These workflows in `.agent/workflows/` are auto-detected by Antigravity:

| Slash Command | Source | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `/securityAudit` | Trail of Bits | Full security audit: context-building → static analysis → sharp edges → variant analysis → supply chain |
| `/modernPython` | Trail of Bits | Modern Python with uv, ruff, ty |
| `/tdd` | Superpowers | Test-Driven Development: red-green-refactor |
| `/systematicDebugging` | Superpowers | Root cause investigation before fixes |
| `/propertyBasedTesting` | Trail of Bits | Hypothesis-style property testing |
| `/desloppify` | Codomyrmex | Codebase health scanner: strict score via scan → `next` → resolve loop ([skill](../skills/desloppify/SKILL.md)) |

## How Antigravity Uses These Skills

1. **Auto-triggered workflows**: `/securityAudit`, `/modernPython`, `/tdd`, `/systematicDebugging`, `/propertyBasedTesting` — summarized instructions with `view_file` references to full SKILL.md
2. **On-demand full instructions**: Use `view_file <path>` on any SKILL.md above to load the complete skill into context
3. **Keyword match**: Ask Antigravity to "do a security audit" or "use TDD" and it will find the matching workflow
