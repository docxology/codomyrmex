# Logging & Monitoring - Module-Specific Requirements

# This module (`logging_monitoring`) primarily utilizes Python's built-in `logging` module
# and relies on `python-dotenv` for environment variable loading.

# `python-dotenv` is a project-wide dependency and is managed in the root `requirements.txt` file.

# There are currently no additional Python package dependencies specific to this module
# that are not already covered by the root `requirements.txt` or Python's standard library.

# If future enhancements (e.g., integration with advanced logging libraries like `structlog`,
# or specific log shipping/monitoring client libraries) require additional dependencies
# not intended for project-wide use, they should be listed here with pinned versions.
# Example:
# # structlog==23.1.0
# # opentelemetry-api==1.18.0

# PLEASE RENAME/ADAPT THIS FILE and its contents based on the primary language and package manager for this module.
# For example:
# - Python: `requirements.txt` (pip), `environment.yml` (conda), or `pyproject.toml` (poetry/pdm)
# - Node.js: `package.json`
# - Java: `pom.xml` (Maven), `build.gradle` (Gradle)
# - Go: `go.mod`
# - Rust: `Cargo.toml`
# - Ruby: `Gemfile`
# - etc.

# Example for a Python module (if this were `requirements.txt`):
# requests==2.25.1
# numpy>=1.20.0
# pandas # for latest version

# Example for a Node.js module (if this were `package.json`, content would be JSON):
# {
#   "name": "module-name",
#   "version": "0.1.0",
#   "dependencies": {
#     "library-a": "^1.2.3",
#     "library-b": "~4.5.6"
#   },
#   "devDependencies": {
#     "testing-framework": "^7.8.9"
#   }
# }

# Add your module-specific dependencies below, following the appropriate format for your chosen language/tooling.

# [Dependency Name]==[Version Specifier] # e.g., my-library==1.0.0
# [Another Dependency]>=[Minimum Version] # e.g., another-lib>=2.1

# This module's Python dependencies are currently met by the global `requirements.txt`
# in the project root.
#
# If this module later develops specific Python dependencies not included globally,
# they should be listed here.

# This module may have specific logging library dependencies.
# If using Loguru and it's not in the root requirements.txt, add it here:
# loguru>=0.7.0

# If other dependencies are covered by the root requirements.txt, state that.
# Otherwise, list all specific dependencies for this module here.
