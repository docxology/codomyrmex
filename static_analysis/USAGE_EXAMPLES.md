# Static Analysis - Usage Examples

## Example 1: Basic Usage

(Provide a simple, clear example of how to use a core feature of this module.)

```
# Code snippet or command
# ...
```

### Expected Outcome

(Describe what the user should expect to see or happen.)

## Example 2: Advanced Scenario

(Illustrate a more complex or advanced use case.)

```
# Code snippet or command
# ...
```

### Configuration (if any)

(Detail any specific configuration needed for this example.)

### Expected Outcome

(Describe the result of this advanced scenario.)

## Example 3: Running Pyrefly for Type Checking

This example demonstrates invoking the `run_static_analysis` tool to perform type checking using Pyrefly on a specific module.

```json
{
  "tool_name": "run_static_analysis",
  "arguments": {
    "target_paths": ["src/user_authentication_module/"],
    "tools": ["pyrefly"],
    "language": "python"
  }
}
```

### Configuration (if any)

- Pyrefly will look for a `pyrefly.toml` file in the project root or a `[tool.pyrefly]` section in `pyproject.toml` for its configuration.
- Ensure that the `python_version` and other relevant settings in Pyrefly's configuration are appropriate for the `user_authentication_module`.

### Expected Outcome

The tool will execute Pyrefly on the specified path. The output will include:
- A `status` of "success" or "completed_with_issues".
- A `summary` indicating the number of type errors found by Pyrefly (if any).
- A `tool_results` array containing an object for Pyrefly, with details about the issues found, including file paths, line numbers, and error messages.
- Potentially a `report_path` to a more detailed report generated by Pyrefly.
