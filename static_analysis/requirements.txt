# Static Analysis - Requirements

# This file lists the packages and dependencies required for the Static Analysis module.
# The `environment_setup/` module may use this file to provision the necessary environment.

# PLEASE RENAME/ADAPT THIS FILE and its contents based on the primary language and package manager for this module.
# For example:
# - Python: `requirements.txt` (pip), `environment.yml` (conda), or `pyproject.toml` (poetry/pdm)
# - Node.js: `package.json`
# - Java: `pom.xml` (Maven), `build.gradle` (Gradle)
# - Go: `go.mod`
# - Rust: `Cargo.toml`
# - Ruby: `Gemfile`
# - etc.

# Example for a Python module (if this were `requirements.txt`):
# requests==2.25.1
# numpy>=1.20.0
# pandas # for latest version

# Example for a Node.js module (if this were `package.json`, content would be JSON):
# {
#   "name": "module-name",
#   "version": "0.1.0",
#   "dependencies": {
#     "library-a": "^1.2.3",
#     "library-b": "~4.5.6"
#   },
#   "devDependencies": {
#     "testing-framework": "^7.8.9"
#   }
# }

# Add your module-specific dependencies below, following the appropriate format for your chosen language/tooling.

# If this module is Python-based and all its dependencies are already covered by the
# project's root requirements.txt, please note that here explicitly.
# e.g.:
# # This module currently uses dependencies from the root requirements.txt file.

# [Dependency Name]==[Version Specifier] # e.g., my-library==1.0.0
# [Another Dependency]>=[Minimum Version] # e.g., another-lib>=2.1
