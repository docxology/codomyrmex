# Static Analysis - Requirements

# This file lists module-specific Python packages for the Static Analysis module.
# These are typically linters, code complexity analyzers, and security scanners.

# Linters
pylint==3.3.7
flake8==7.2.0

# Security Scanner
bandit==1.8.3

# Complexity and Maintainability Metrics
radon==6.0.1
lizard==1.17.30

# Common project-wide dependencies are managed in the root `requirements.txt` file.
# If this module needs other specialized static analysis tools not used elsewhere,
# they should be listed here with pinned versions.
# Example:
# # mypy==1.0.0 # For type checking, if not used globally

# PLEASE RENAME/ADAPT THIS FILE and its contents based on the primary language and package manager for this module.
# For example:
# - Python: `requirements.txt` (pip), `environment.yml` (conda), or `pyproject.toml` (poetry/pdm)
# - Node.js: `package.json`
# - Java: `pom.xml` (Maven), `build.gradle` (Gradle)
# - Go: `go.mod`
# - Rust: `Cargo.toml`
# - Ruby: `Gemfile`
# - etc.

# Example for a Python module (if this were `requirements.txt`):
# requests==2.25.1
# numpy>=1.20.0
# pandas # for latest version

# Example for a Node.js module (if this were `package.json`, content would be JSON):
# {
#   "name": "module-name",
#   "version": "0.1.0",
#   "dependencies": {
#     "library-a": "^1.2.3",
#     "library-b": "~4.5.6"
#   },
#   "devDependencies": {
#     "testing-framework": "^7.8.9"
#   }
# }

# Add your module-specific dependencies below, following the appropriate format for your chosen language/tooling.

# If this module is Python-based and all its dependencies are already covered by the
# project's root requirements.txt, please note that here explicitly.
# e.g.:
# This module currently uses dependencies from the root requirements.txt file.
# However, it will likely require specific linters or analysis tools.
# Example:
# pylint>=2.15
# flake8>=5.0
# bandit>=1.7

# [Dependency Name]==[Version Specifier] # e.g., my-library==1.0.0
# [Another Dependency]>=[Minimum Version] # e.g., another-lib>=2.1
