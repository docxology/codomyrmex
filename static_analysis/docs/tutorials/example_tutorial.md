# Static Analysis - Example Tutorial: Getting Started with [Feature X]

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using [Feature X] of the Static Analysis module.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- The Static Analysis module installed and configured (see main [README.md](../README.md)).
- (Any specific tools, accounts, or data needed for this tutorial, e.g., an API key, sample data file).
- Familiarity with (basic concepts related to the module or feature).

## 2. Goal

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- (State the primary learning objective, e.g., "Successfully process [type of data] using [Feature X]").
- (Understand the basic workflow of [Feature X]).

## 3. Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Input

(Describe how to prepare any necessary input data or environment for the tutorial.)

```bash
# Example: Create a sample configuration file
cat << EOF > ./sample_config.json
{
  "setting1": "value1",
  "setting2": true
}
EOF
```

### Step 2: Invoke [Feature X]

(Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to use the feature. Include code snippets or commands.)

**Using a command-line tool (example):**

```bash
module_cli_tool feature-x --input ./sample_data.txt --config ./sample_config.json
```

**Using a library function (Python example):**

```python
from module_name import feature_x_processor

input_data = "Some data to process."
config = {"setting1": "value1"}

result = feature_x_processor.process(data=input_data, config=config)
print(f"Processed result: {result}")
```

### Step 3: Verify the Output

(Explain how to check if the feature worked correctly. What should the output look like?)

- Check for a success message: `Processing completed successfully.`
- Examine the output file: `output/result.txt` should contain...
- Verify a database record was created: `SELECT * FROM results_table WHERE ...`

## 4. Understanding the Results

(Briefly explain the output or outcome of the tutorial steps. What does it mean?)

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Error: `[Common Error Message]`**
  - **Cause**: (Likely cause of the error.)
  - **Solution**: (How to fix it.)
- **Output is not as expected**: 
  - Double-check your input data and configuration against the examples.
  - Consult the [API Specification](../API_SPECIFICATION.md) for `feature_x`.

## 6. Next Steps

Congratulations on completing this tutorial!

Now you can try:
- Exploring [Related Feature Y].
- Using [Feature X] with your own data.
- Consulting the [Advanced Usage Guide for Feature X](./advanced_feature_x_guide.md) (if applicable).
