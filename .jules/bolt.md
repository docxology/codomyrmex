## 2026-03-10 - Refactored Synchronous API Wrappers for asyncio Completeness

**Vulnerability/Performance Issue:** Synchronous blocking `time.sleep` calls were present in retry loops during API interaction logic. When the framework executes in an event loop environment, these synchronous blocking calls could stall the event loop. Furthermore, maintaining split implementation blocks (sync vs async) introduced duplication and bugs.
**Learning:** `asyncio.run()` cannot be called when an event loop is already running. For unified API endpoints needing sync wrappers that might be called within existing asyncio event loops, standard practice is to use a ThreadPoolExecutor wrapper (`pool.submit(asyncio.run, coro).result()`) to isolate the new loop from the running one, thus preventing `RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`.
**Prevention:** Avoid split sync/async codebase logic if async wrappers or pure async calls are sufficient. Always test sync-wrapper methods in an event loop environment (e.g., using `pytest.mark.asyncio`) to catch runtime boundary errors.

## 2024-07-10 - Avoid inline dictionaries for type mapping

**Learning:** Recreating static dictionaries on every function call (e.g. `type_map = {"int": int, ...}` inside `deserialize`) adds significant overhead in frequently called code paths.
**Action:** Move static mapping dictionaries to class-level or module-level constants (e.g. `_TYPE_MAP`) to initialize them once and eliminate per-call allocation overhead.

## 2026-07-13 - Inline Set Optimization
**Learning:** In Python, inline set literals (e.g., `if name in {'a', 'b'}:`) are compiled into `frozenset` constants for O(1) membership checks without repeated instantiation overhead. However, when generating source code strings where elements are injected or repeated, extracting them to module-level `frozenset` constants ensures optimal memory and allocation behavior during the generated module's runtime execution.
**Action:** Replaced an O(N) list check generated inside a loop with a module-level `frozenset` constant `_README_VARIANTS`.
