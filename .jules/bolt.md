## 2026-03-10 - Refactored Synchronous API Wrappers for asyncio Completeness

**Vulnerability/Performance Issue:** Synchronous blocking `time.sleep` calls were present in retry loops during API interaction logic. When the framework executes in an event loop environment, these synchronous blocking calls could stall the event loop. Furthermore, maintaining split implementation blocks (sync vs async) introduced duplication and bugs.
**Learning:** `asyncio.run()` cannot be called when an event loop is already running. For unified API endpoints needing sync wrappers that might be called within existing asyncio event loops, standard practice is to use a ThreadPoolExecutor wrapper (`pool.submit(asyncio.run, coro).result()`) to isolate the new loop from the running one, thus preventing `RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`.
**Prevention:** Avoid split sync/async codebase logic if async wrappers or pure async calls are sufficient. Always test sync-wrapper methods in an event loop environment (e.g., using `pytest.mark.asyncio`) to catch runtime boundary errors.

## 2024-07-10 - Avoid inline dictionaries for type mapping

**Learning:** Recreating static dictionaries on every function call (e.g. `type_map = {"int": int, ...}` inside `deserialize`) adds significant overhead in frequently called code paths.
**Action:** Move static mapping dictionaries to class-level or module-level constants (e.g. `_TYPE_MAP`) to initialize them once and eliminate per-call allocation overhead.
## 2026-07-13 - Optimize open_gauss run_agent membership checks
**Learning:** In Python, inline literal sets (e.g., `if name in {'a', 'b', 'c'}:`) are optimized at compile-time into `frozenset` constants, making membership checks O(1) and substantially faster than lists, without the overhead of runtime allocation.
**Action:** Replaced literal list membership checks with set literals in `src/codomyrmex/agents/open_gauss/run_agent.py`.
