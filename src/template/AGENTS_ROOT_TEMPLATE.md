- `[subdirectory2]/` – Agent surface for `[subdirectory2]` components.

## Operating Contracts
- Maintain alignment between code, documentation, and configured workflows.
- Ensure Model Context Protocol interfaces remain available for sibling agents.
- Record outcomes in shared telemetry and update TODO queues when necessary.
- All agent-exposed tasks and handlers MUST be real, executable implementations. No stubs.
