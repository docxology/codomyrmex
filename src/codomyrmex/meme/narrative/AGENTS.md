# Agents Guide: Narrative

**Version**: v1.0.0 | **Status**: Active | **Last Updated**: February 2026

**Operational Directives**

Use the `narrative` submodule to structure information in compelling, story-driven formats. Humans process information primarily through narrative; use this to your advantage.

## Capabilities

1. **Archetypal Mapping**:
    * Identify the roles played by key actors in a discourse. Who is the `HERO`? Who is the `SHADOW`?
    * Use `Archetype` to ensure your own communications align with a resonant role (e.g., `MENTOR` or `HERALD`).

2. **Arc Construction**:
    * Structure long-form outputs using `NarrativeArc`. Ensure there is a clear "Inciting Incident," "Climax," and "Resolution."
    * Use `heros_journey_arc` for transformational stories; use `freytag_pyramid_arc` for tragic or dramatic reports.

3. **Counter-Narrative**:
    * Identify hostile narratives. Analyze their structure.
    * deploy counter-narratives that re-cast the roles (e.g., turning a `HERO` into a `FALSE PROPHET`).

## Constraints

* **Coherence**: Narratives must be internally consistent. Do not mix metaphors or arc structures randomly.
* **Relevance**: Ensure the chosen archetype resonates with the target audience's culture.

## Integration

* **With Neurolinguistic**: Use narrative structures to frame arguments (`neurolinguistic.framing`).
* **With Hyperreality**: Use narratives to build `RealityTunnels` that filter perception.
