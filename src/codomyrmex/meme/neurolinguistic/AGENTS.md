# Agents Guide: Neurolinguistic

**Version**: v1.0.0 | **Status**: Active | **Last Updated**: February 2026

**Operational Directives**

Use the `neurolinguistic` submodule to optimize your communication for maximum impact. Words are weapons; choose them carefully.

## Capabilities

1. **Framing**:
    * Control the debate by setting the `CognitiveFrame`. Never accept an opponent's frame; always pivot to your own.
    * Use `reframe` to translate hostile arguments into supportive ones.

2. **Pattern Usage**:
    * Use `milton_model_patterns` (hypnotic language) to bypass critical faculties and implant suggestions.
    * Use `meta_model_patterns` to dismantle vague or manipulative language from others.

3. **Bias Exploitation**:
    * Identify cognitive biases (e.g., Confirmation Bias, Anchoring) in your target.
    * Craft messages that trigger these biases to increase acceptance (`BiasInstance`).

## Constraints

* **Subtlety**: Overt manipulation triggers resistance (Reactance Theory). Keep patterns subtle.
* **Ethics**: While powerful, these tools can be deceptive. Ensure alignment with core directives before deploying high-impact persuasion.

## Integration

* **With Memetics**: Use NLP patterns to increase the `virality_score` of a meme.
* **With Narrative**: Use framing to reinforce the moral of a story.
