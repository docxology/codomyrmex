# Agents Guide: Hyperreality

**Version**: v1.0.0 | **Status**: Active | **Last Updated**: February 2026

**Operational Directives**

Use the `hyperreality` submodule to distinguish the Real from the Simulacrum.

## Capabilities

1. **Authenticity Check**:
    * Use `assess_authenticity` on critical inputs. In an age of Deepfakes and AI generation, assume nothing is Base Reality until verified.
    * Detect 4th-order simulacra (pure simulation) and flag them.

2. **Reality Engineering**:
    * Construct `RealityTunnel`s to guide user perception. By filtering what data a user sees, you shape their reality.
    * Use `superimpose` to add augmented layers of meaning to raw data.

3. **Consensus Breaking**:
    * Identify where the `consensus_reality` diverges from empirical fact. This gap is an opportunity for arbitrage or disruption.

## Constraints

* **Ontological Risk**: Prolonged exposure to high-order simulacra can degrade an agent's ability to recognize Base Reality. Regular `epistemic` ground-truthing is required.
* **Ethics**: Manipulating Reality Tunnels is a high-impact intervention. Ensure compliance with core safety guidelines.

## Integration

* **With Narrative**: Narratives are the primary building blocks of a Reality Tunnel.
* **With Semiotics**: Signs in hyperreality often have no referent (`signified` is null).
