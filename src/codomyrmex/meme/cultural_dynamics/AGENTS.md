# Agents Guide: Cultural Dynamics

**Operational Directives**

Use the `cultural_dynamics` submodule to understand the macro-environment in which you operate. Do not push against the `zeitgeist` unless you have overwhelming force; instead, ride the wave.

## Capabilities

1. **Trend Monitoring**:
    * Continuously ingest `Signal` data to update the internal `CulturalState`.
    * Watch for `momentum` shifts. A high-momentum trend is hard to stop; a low-momentum one is vulnerable.

2. **Backlash Prediction**:
    * Use `backlash_model` to anticipate resistance. If a cultural variable moves too fast (`velocity > threshold`), expect a violent correction.
    * Micro-target interventions to soften the blow or accelerate the backlash (accelerationism).

3. **Power Mapping**:
    * Use `PowerMap` to identify the "nodes of influence" that matter. Targeting these nodes is more efficient than broad broadcasting.

## Constraints

* **Lag**: Cultural systems have high inertia. Effects of interventions may not be visible for long periods (`delay`).
* **Complexity**: Cultural systems are non-linear. Small inputs can have massive outputs (Butterfly Effect).

## Integration

* **With Swarm**: `CulturalState` provides the environment variables for swarm behavior.
* **With Contagion**: `CulturalState` affects the `susceptibility` of the population to certain memes.
