# Agents Guide: Meme Module

**Capabilities & Directives for Autonomous Agents**

This document outlines the capabilities of the `codomyrmex.meme` module and provides directives for agents (AI or simulated) interacting with it.

## Core Directives

1. **Treat Information as Biological**: Approach all text, code, and data as living substrates capable of mutation and evolution.
2. **Zero-Mock Policy**: Use real functional methods for all analysis. Do not simulate outputs unless explicitly testing the `hyperreality` module.
3. **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: Combine insights from multiple submodules (e.g., use `neurolinguistic` framing to optimize `memetic` fitness).

## Agent Capabilities by Submodule

### Memetics (`memetics`)

* **Dissect & Synthesize**: Break down complex texts into atomic memes and recombine them.
* **Evolutionary Optimization**: Run genetic algorithms to evolve more effective messaging.
* **Fitness Evaluation**: Assess the viral potential (fecundity) and staying power (longevity) of ideas.

### Semiotics (`semiotic`)

* **Decode Hidden Meaning**: Analyze signifiers to find latent meaning or steganographic payloads.
* **Track Drift**: Monitor how the meaning of terms changes over time or across contexts.

### Propagation (`contagion`)

* **Predict Spread**: Use SIR/SEIR models to forecast information diffusion.
* **Detect Cascades**: Identify early signs of viral outbreaks or information cascades.

### Narrative (`narrative`)

* **Construct Myths**: Synthesize compelling narratives using established archetypes and structures.
* **Analyze Arcs**: Determine where a current event sits within a broader narrative trajectory.

### Cultural Dynamics (`cultural_dynamics`)

* **Map Power**: Identify key power brokers and resource flows.
* **Predict Backlash**: Model cultural oscillation (pendulum swings) to anticipate reactions.

### Swarm (`swarm`)

* **Coordinate**: Use flocking rules to coordinate with other agents without central control.
* **Consensus**: Reach agreement on shared facts or goals using distributed consensus algorithms.

### Neurolinguistic (`neurolinguistic`)

* **Persuasion**: optimized language patterns (Milton Model) for influence.
* **Frame Control**: Detect and reframe hostile narratives.

### Ideoscape (`ideoscape`)

* **Visualize**: Generate topographic maps of the information landscape.
* **Navigate**: Identify "high ground" (dominant ideas) and "valleys" (marginalized concepts).

### Rhizome (`rhizome`)

* **Connect**: Establish non-hierarchical connections between disparate data points.
* **Resilience**: Analyze network topology to ensure robustness against node removal.

### Epistemic (`epistemic`)

* **Verify Truth**: rigorously check claims against evidence models.
* **Defend Reality**: Detect and counter fabricated evidence or gaslighting attempts.

### Hyperreality (`hyperreality`)

* **Assess Authenticity**: Determine the simulation level of an object or event (Real vs. Hyperreal).
* **Engineer Simulacra**: Create high-fidelity simulations for testing or camouflage.

### Cybernetic (`cybernetic`)

* **Regulate**: Maintain system stability via negative feedback loops.
* **Amplify**: Use positive feedback to accelerate desired trends.
