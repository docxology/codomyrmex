# Meme - MCP Tool Specification

This document outlines the specification for tools within the Meme module that are intended to be integrated with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Current Status: No MCP Tools Defined

The Meme module provides a comprehensive memetic warfare and information dynamics framework for internal use by other Codomyrmex modules, including a core memetic engine (Meme, Memeplex, fitness, mutation), computational semiotics (signs, encoding, drift), information cascade and epidemic propagation models, computational narratology (arcs, myths, insurgency), cultural oscillation and power dynamics, Baudrillardian simulacra and consensus engineering, swarm intelligence (ACO, PSO, stigmergy, emergence), cognitive framing and bias exploitation, ideational ecosystem ecology, rhizomatic network analysis, epistemic territory mapping and knowledge warfare, and cybernetic control theory with feedback engineering. These functions are primarily for programmatic integration within the application lifecycle and are not suited for exposure as Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools.

MCP tools are typically designed for discrete, invocable actions or queries that an external agent (like an LLM) would trigger. The internal memetic warfare and information dynamics mechanisms do not fit this paradigm.

If future enhancements to this module introduce features that are appropriate for MCP (e.g., analyzing a narrative arc from text input, or modeling information propagation through a network), this document will be updated accordingly.

For details on how to use the meme functionalities within your Python code, please refer to the module's `README.md` and `API_SPECIFICATION.md`.
