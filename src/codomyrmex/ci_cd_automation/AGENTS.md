# Codomyrmex Agents — src/codomyrmex/ci_cd_automation

**Version**: v0.1.0 | **Status**: Active | **Last Updated**: January 2025

## Purpose
CI/CD automation agents orchestrating comprehensive software delivery pipelines, managing deployment workflows, quality gates, and release management across multiple environments.

## Active Components
- `deployment_orchestrator.py` – Advanced deployment coordination with rollback capabilities and environment management
- `pipeline_manager.py` – Pipeline configuration and execution engine supporting multiple CI/CD platforms
- `__init__.py` – Package initialization and CI/CD utilities exports
- `README.md` – Comprehensive documentation for pipeline setup and deployment strategies

## Operating Contracts
- Maintain alignment between code, documentation, and configured workflows.
- Ensure Model Context Protocol interfaces remain available for sibling agents.
- Record outcomes in shared telemetry and update TODO queues when necessary.
- Deployment processes maintain zero-downtime when possible and handle rollbacks gracefully.
- Pipeline execution maintains audit trails and supports compliance requirements.
- Quality gates prevent deployment of substandard code while maintaining development velocity.

## Related Modules
- **Build Synthesis** (`build_synthesis/`) - Provides build artifacts for deployment
- **Containerization** (`containerization/`) - Manages containerized deployments
- **Git Operations** (`git_operations/`) - Handles version control and release tagging
- **Project Orchestration** (`project_orchestration/`) - Coordinates complex multi-stage deployments

## Checkpoints
- [ ] Confirm AGENTS.md reflects the current module purpose.
- [ ] Verify logging and telemetry hooks for this directory's agents.
- [ ] Sync automation scripts or TODO entries after modifications.
