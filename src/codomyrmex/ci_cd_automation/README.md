### ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Analytics
- **Pipeline Analytics**: Track pipeline performance and success rates
- **Deployment Metrics**: Monitor deployment success and timing
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live pipeline and deployment status
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify and optimize slow pipelines

## Quick Start

```python
from codomyrmex.ci_cd_automation import PipelineManager, DeploymentOrchestrator

# Create and run a pipeline
pipeline_manager = PipelineManager()
pipeline = pipeline_manager.create_pipeline("pipeline_config.yaml")
result = pipeline_manager.run_pipeline("my-app-pipeline")

# Deploy to production
deploy_orchestrator = DeploymentOrchestrator()
deployment = deploy_orchestrator.create_deployment(
    name="my-app-v1.0.0",
    version="1.0.0",
    environment_name="production",
    artifacts=["dist/my-app.tar.gz"]
)
result = deploy_orchestrator.deploy("my-app-v1.0.0")
```

## Pipeline Configuration

Create a `pipeline_config.yaml`:

```yaml
name: "my-app-pipeline"
description: "CI/CD pipeline for my application"

variables:
  DOCKER_REGISTRY: "my-registry.com"
  ENVIRONMENT: "production"

stages:
  - name: "build"
    parallel: true
    jobs:
      - name: "build-frontend"
        commands:
          - "cd frontend && npm install && npm run build"
        artifacts:
          - "frontend/dist/**/*"
      - name: "build-backend"
        commands:
          - "cd backend && python setup.py build"
        artifacts:
          - "backend/dist/**/*"

  - name: "test"
    dependencies: ["build"]
    jobs:
      - name: "unit-tests"
        commands:
          - "pytest tests/unit/"
      - name: "integration-tests"
        commands:
          - "pytest tests/integration/"

  - name: "deploy"
    dependencies: ["test"]
    jobs:
      - name: "deploy-production"
        commands:
          - "kubectl apply -f k8s/production.yaml"
```

## Deployment Configuration

Create a `deployment_config.yaml`:

```yaml
environments:
  - name: "development"
    type: "development"
    host: "dev.example.com"
    docker_registry: "dev-registry.example.com"
    health_checks:
      - type: "http"
        endpoint: "http://dev.example.com/health"
        timeout: 30

  - name: "production"
    type: "production"
    host: "prod.example.com"
    kubernetes_context: "prod-cluster"
    pre_deploy_hooks:
      - "kubectl create namespace my-app --dry-run=client"
    post_deploy_hooks:
      - "kubectl wait --for=condition=available deployment/my-app"
    health_checks:
      - type: "http"
        endpoint: "http://prod.example.com/health"
        timeout: 60
```

## Advanced Features

### Pipeline Templates
```python
# Use predefined templates
template = pipeline_manager.get_template("python-web-app")
pipeline = pipeline_manager.create_from_template(template, variables={"app_name": "my-app"})
```

### Deployment Strategies
```python
# Blue-green deployment
deployment = orchestrator.create_deployment(
    name="my-app-blue",
    strategy="blue_green",
    environment_name="production",
    artifacts=["blue-deployment.yaml"]
)
```

### Custom Health Checks
```python
# Add custom health check
orchestrator.add_health_check("production", {
    "type": "custom",
    "command": "curl -f http://localhost:8080/health",
    "timeout": 30
})
```

## Integration Points

- **project_orchestration**: Pipeline orchestration and workflow management
- **security_audit**: Security scanning and compliance checks in pipelines
- **logging_monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **static_analysis**: Code quality checks in CI pipelines
- **data_visualization**: Pipeline analytics and reporting

## Best Practices

1. **Pipeline Design**
   - Keep pipelines modular and reusable
   - Use parallel execution for independent jobs
   - Implement proper error handling and retries
   - Cache dependencies to speed up builds

2. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Use blue-green deployments for zero-downtime
   - Implement comprehensive health checks
   - Always have rollback plans
   - Monitor deployments in real-time

3. **Security**
   - Store secrets securely (not in pipeline configs)
   - Implement security scanning in pipelines
   - Use least privilege for deployment accounts
   - Audit all deployment activities

4. **Monitoring**
   - Track pipeline success rates and durations
   - Monitor deployment health and performance
   - Set up alerts for failed deployments
   - Generate regular reports and analytics

## Dependencies

- `docker`: Docker Python client for container operations
- `kubernetes`: Kubernetes Python client
- `PyYAML`: YAML configuration file support
- `requests`: HTTP health checks

## Contributing

When contributing to the CI/CD Automation module:

1. Follow pipeline design best practices
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Include health checks for new deployment types
4. Update documentation for new features
5. Test pipelines with various configurations
6. Ensure backward compatibility
