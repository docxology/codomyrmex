# Cursor Rules for the static_analysis Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `static_analysis` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Centralizes linting, security scanning, code quality metrics, and other static analysis tasks for the Codomyrmex project.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Linters (ESLint, Pylint, Flake8), security scanners (SonarQube, CodeQL, Bandit), code quality tools (Radon, Lizard), potentially `analysis-tools.dev` for integrating various analyzers.
-   Refer to this module's main `README.md` for information on configured tools and how to run analyses.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `static_analysis` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: How to run static analysis, interpret results, and configure tools.
-   Configuration files for analysis tools (e.g., `.eslintrc.js`, `pylintrc`, SonarQube project settings if managed here).
-   Scripts for running analysis tools and aggregating reports.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: If analysis results are exposed via an API.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: If MCP tools are provided to trigger analyses or query results.
-   `docs/`: Detailed guides on specific linters/scanners, how to fix common issues, and understanding quality metrics.
-   `pyproject.toml`: Dependencies managed centrally via uv.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `static_analysis`
-   **Tool Configuration**: Configurations for linters and scanners should be consistent with project coding standards and aim to improve code quality and security.
-   **Actionable Reporting**: Analysis results should be presented in an actionable way, making it easy for developers to find and fix issues.
-   **Baseline and New Issues**: Differentiate between new issues introduced by changes and existing codebase issues (if applicable, e.g., SonarQube quality gates).
-   **Integration with Development Workflow**: Aim to integrate static analysis early in the development cycle (e.g., pre-commit hooks, CI checks).

## 4. Testing in `static_analysis`
-   Test configurations of analysis tools to ensure they are correctly identifying known issues in sample code.
-   Verify that scripts for running analyses work correctly.
-   Test integration with CI/CD if static analysis is part of automated checks.

## 5. Documentation for `static_analysis`
-   Clearly document which tools are used and how they are configured.
-   Provide guidance on interpreting reports and fixing common issues flagged by the analyzers.
-   Explain how to customize or suppress specific rules if necessary (with justification).

## 6. Specific Considerations for `static_analysis`
-   **False Positives**: Be aware of and manage potential false positives from analysis tools. Provide mechanisms or documentation for suppression where appropriate.
-   **Performance**: Static analysis runs should be reasonably fast to avoid significantly slowing down development workflows or CI builds.
-   **Extensibility**: Allow for easy addition or updating of analysis tools and rule sets.
-   **Focus on Prevention**: Static analysis should help prevent bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code quality issues from entering the codebase.

## 7. Final Check for `static_analysis`
-   Ensure analysis tools are correctly configured and produce accurate, actionable results.
-   Verify that documentation clearly explains how to use the tools and interpret their output.
-   Confirm that the chosen tools and configurations align with the project's quality and security goals.
