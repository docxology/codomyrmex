# Cursor Rules for the model_context_protocol Module (Cross-Module)

## 0. Preamble
These rules apply when *using* the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in other Codomyrmex modules to define tools, consume MCP-compliant services, or integrate with AI models. They supplement `general.cursorrules` and focus on cross-module MCP usage patterns. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here.

**Note**: For rules about *developing and maintaining* the MCP specification and protocol implementation itself, see `modules/model_context_protocol.cursorrules`. This file focuses on *consuming* MCP across the project.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Defines the schema, protocols, and potentially client/server implementations for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI models within the Codomyrmex ecosystem.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Data serialization formats (JSON, Protocol Buffers), API design principles, schema definition languages (JSON Schema, OpenAPI).
-   Refer to this module's main `README.md` for the protocol specification and design rationale.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `model_context_protocol` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: Overview of the protocol, its purpose, and how to use it.
-   Schema definitions (e.g., JSON schemas, `.proto` files): These are the core of the protocol.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: If the MCP itself is exposed via a control API.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: **Crucial**: This file (or files like it) within *other* modules define how *their* tools conform to the MCP. This module defines the *rules* for those specifications.
-   `docs/`: Detailed explanation of protocol messages, data types, interaction patterns, and versioning strategy.
-   Example client/server implementations or SDKs (if any).

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `model_context_protocol`
-   **Schema Clarity**: Protocol schemas must be clear, unambiguous, and well-documented.
-   **Versioning**: Implement a clear versioning strategy for the protocol to handle changes non-disruptively.
-   **Extensibility**: Design the protocol to be extensible for future needs without breaking backward compatibility if possible.
-   **Efficiency**: Consider the efficiency of data serialization and transmission if performance is critical.
-   **Consistency**: Ensure that all tools across Codomyrmex that use MCP adhere strictly to the defined protocol.

## 4. Testing in `model_context_protocol`
-   Test schema validation thoroughly.
-   Test serialization and deserialization of protocol messages.
-   If client/server implementations are provided, test their conformance to the protocol.
-   Test different versions of the protocol if versioning is implemented.

## 5. Documentation for `model_context_protocol`
-   The protocol specification in `README.md` and `docs/` must be precise and comprehensive.
-   Provide clear examples of request and response messages for different use cases.
-   Document the versioning strategy and how to handle updates.
-   Guide developers of other modules on how to create `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` files that comply with this protocol.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `model_context_protocol`
-   **Interoperability**: The primary goal is to ensure interoperability between AI models and various Codomyrmex modules. Changes should be carefully evaluated for their impact on this.
-   **Security**: Consider security aspects of the protocol, such as authentication/authorization for accessing MCP-enabled tools if the protocol involves a transport layer with such concerns.
-   **Tool Definition Standards**: This module sets the standard for how `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` files are structured in other modules. Ensure this standard is clear and easy to follow.

## 7. Final Check for `model_context_protocol`
-   Verify that the protocol specification is complete and unambiguous.
-   Ensure that any schema definitions are correct and validated.
-   Confirm that documentation adequately explains how to use and implement the protocol.
