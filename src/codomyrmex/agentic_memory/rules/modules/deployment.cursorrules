# Cursor Rules for the deployment Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `deployment` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Provides deployment automation and infrastructure management including deployment pipelines, environment provisioning, and release management.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, IaC tools (Terraform, Pulumi), deployment scripts, blue-green/canary strategies, rollback mechanisms.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `deployment` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Deployment module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Critical security considerations for deployment operations.
-   `pyproject.toml`: Python dependencies (managed centrally via uv).
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Deployment.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `deployment`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `deployment` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for deployment configurations.
-   **Idempotency**: All deployment operations must be idempotent.
-   **Rollback Support**: Every deployment must have a clear rollback path.
-   **Environment Isolation**: Strictly isolate environments (dev, staging, prod).
-   **Secrets Management**: Never store secrets in deployment scripts or version control.

## 4. Testing in `deployment`
-   New features (e.g., new deployment strategies, provisioning) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover deployment workflows, rollback procedures, and failure scenarios.
-   Use real infrastructure with environment-gated tests (Zero-Mock policy).
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `deployment/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `deployment`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document deployment procedures, environment configurations, and runbooks.
-   Include rollback procedures for all deployment types.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `deployment`
-   **Production Safety**: Extra care required for production deployments.
-   **Health Checks**: Implement proper health checks for deployment verification.
-   **Gradual Rollout**: Support canary and blue-green deployment patterns.
-   **Monitoring Integration**: Integrate with telemetry for deployment monitoring.

## 7. Final Check for `deployment`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that deployment operations are reliable and have proper rollback.
-   Test integration with related modules like `cloud`, `containerization`, and `ci_cd_automation`.
