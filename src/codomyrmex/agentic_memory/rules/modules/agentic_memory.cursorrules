# Cursor Rules for the agentic_memory Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `agentic_memory` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Provides long-term agent memory with retrieval and persistence capabilities, enabling agents to maintain context across sessions and conversations.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, vector databases, embedding models, RAG patterns, semantic search, memory indexing.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `agentic_memory` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Agentic Memory module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for memory storage and retrieval.
-   `pyproject.toml`: Python dependencies (managed centrally via uv).
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Agentic Memory.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `agentic_memory`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `agentic_memory` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for memory objects and retrieval parameters.
-   **Embedding Consistency**: Use consistent embedding models for storage and retrieval.
-   **Memory Schemas**: Define clear schemas for different memory types (episodic, semantic, procedural).
-   **Garbage Collection**: Implement memory cleanup strategies to prevent unbounded growth.
-   **Versioning**: Support memory schema versioning for forward compatibility.

## 4. Testing in `agentic_memory`
-   New features (e.g., new memory types, retrieval algorithms) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover memory storage, retrieval accuracy, persistence, and concurrent access.
-   Use real embedding services with environment-gated tests for deterministic behavior (Zero-Mock policy).
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `agentic_memory/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `agentic_memory`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document memory types, storage backends, and retrieval strategies clearly.
-   Include examples of memory usage patterns for different agent scenarios.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `agentic_memory`
-   **Privacy**: Implement data privacy controls; support memory deletion and anonymization.
-   **Storage Efficiency**: Optimize storage for large memory corpora.
-   **Retrieval Quality**: Balance retrieval speed with accuracy.
-   **Cross-Agent Sharing**: Support controlled memory sharing between agents when appropriate.
-   **Durability**: Ensure memory persistence with backup and recovery capabilities.

## 7. Final Check for `agentic_memory`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that memory operations are reliable and performant.
-   Test integration with related modules like `agents`, `llm`, and `graph_rag`.
