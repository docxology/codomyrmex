# Cursor Rules for the system_discovery Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `system_discovery` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: This module provides system introspection and analysis capabilities for discovering modules, functions, and system health.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, system introspection, capability scanning, health monitoring, dependency analysis, resource mapping.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `system_discovery` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the System Discovery module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for system introspection and capability scanning.
-   `pyproject.toml`: Python dependencies (managed centrally via uv).
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to System Discovery.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders, e.g., `system_discovery/` itself if it contains Python sources directly): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.
-   `.gitignore`: Module-specific ignored files.
-   `discovery_engine.py`: Core system discovery and analysis functionality.
-   `capability_scanner.py`: Capability detection and resource mapping.
-   `status_reporter.py`: System health monitoring and reporting.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `system_discovery`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `system_discovery` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for discovery results and system configurations.
-   **Privacy**: Respect privacy and security boundaries during system introspection.
-   **Accuracy**: Ensure discovery results are accurate and comprehensive.
-   **Non-Intrusive**: Implement discovery that doesn't disrupt system operations.

## 4. Testing in `system_discovery`
-   New features (e.g., new discovery capabilities, scanning algorithms) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover system scanning, capability detection, health monitoring, and discovery accuracy.
-   Use real system components with environment-gated tests for deterministic behavior (Zero-Mock policy).
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `system_discovery/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `system_discovery`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document discovery algorithms, scanning procedures, and system analysis techniques clearly.
-   Include examples of system discovery and capability mapping usage.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `system_discovery`
-   **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure complete discovery of all system components and capabilities.
-   **Security Boundaries**: Respect security and privacy constraints during system analysis.
-   **Performance**: Optimize discovery processes for minimal system impact.
-   **Accuracy**: Maintain high accuracy in capability detection and system mapping.

## 7. Final Check for `system_discovery`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that system discovery works correctly and provides accurate results.
-   Test integration with related modules like `environment_setup` and `project_orchestration`.
