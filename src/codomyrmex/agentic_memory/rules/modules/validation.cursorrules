# Cursor Rules for the validation Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `validation` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Provides data validation utilities including schema validation, input sanitization, type checking, and constraint enforcement.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, Pydantic, JSON Schema, custom validators, sanitization libraries.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `validation` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Validation module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for input validation.
-   `pyproject.toml`: Python dependencies (managed centrally via uv).
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Validation.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `validation`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `validation` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for validators and schemas.
-   **Fail Fast**: Validators should fail immediately on invalid input.
-   **Clear Errors**: Validation error messages should be specific and actionable.
-   **Composable**: Design validators to be composable and reusable.
-   **Whitelist Approach**: Prefer whitelisting valid patterns over blacklisting invalid ones.

## 4. Testing in `validation`
-   New features (e.g., new validators, schemas) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover valid inputs, invalid inputs, edge cases, and error messages.
-   Include adversarial tests with malicious input patterns.
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `validation/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `validation`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document available validators, their constraints, and usage examples.
-   Include examples of custom validator creation.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `validation`
-   **Security**: Validation is a critical security control; treat changes as security-sensitive.
-   **Performance**: Validators should be efficient for high-throughput use.
-   **Internationalization**: Consider i18n for error messages.
-   **Integration**: Provide easy integration with API and form frameworks.

## 7. Final Check for `validation`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that validators correctly reject invalid input.
-   Test integration with related modules like `api`, `serialization`, and `security`.
