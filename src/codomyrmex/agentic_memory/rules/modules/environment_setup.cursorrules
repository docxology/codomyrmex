# Cursor Rules for the environment_setup Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `environment_setup` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: Provides documentation and scripts (primarily `env_checker.py`) to ensure a consistent and verifiable development environment for the Codomyrmex project. It guides the setup of prerequisites, Python dependencies, and API key configurations (`.env` files).
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python (for `env_checker.py`), Markdown (for documentation), Shell commands (for setup instructions).
-   Refer to this module's `README.md` for a comprehensive overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: Main documentation for project setup and for this module's components.
-   `env_checker.py`: Python script for validating dependencies and `.env` file setup.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Security considerations for the development environment and setup process.
-   `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md`: Examples of using `env_checker.py` and general setup workflows.
-   `docs/technical_overview.md`: Technical details of `env_checker.py` and module design.
-   `docs/tutorials/troubleshooting_common_setup_issues.md`: Guide for resolving common setup problems.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: (Currently a template) For any formal API definitions of `env_checker.py` functions.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: Log changes to this module's scripts or documentation.
-   `pyproject.toml`: All dependencies managed centrally via uv.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices

### For `env_checker.py` (Python):
-   Follow Python PEP 8 guidelines.
-   Ensure script is robust, with clear error messages and appropriate use of `sys.exit()` on critical failures.
-   Prioritize clear, instructional print statements to guide the user.
-   When modifying paths or assumptions about project structure, ensure they remain robust (e.g., `project_root` determination).
-   Avoid handling or logging actual API key values; focus on placeholder guidance and file existence.

### For Documentation (Markdown):
-   Keep setup instructions in `README.md` and troubleshooting guides accurate, up-to-date, and easy to follow for all supported operating systems.
-   Ensure consistency between documented steps and the behavior of `env_checker.py`.
-   Use clear and unambiguous language.

## 4. Testing
-   **`env_checker.py`**:
    -   Manually test `env_checker.py` under various conditions: missing dependencies, missing `.env` file, existing `.env` file, incorrect project root (if that part of the script is modified).
    -   Unit tests (in `tests/`) should cover the logic of `ensure_dependencies_installed` and `check_and_setup_env_vars`, using real file system operations with temp directories (Zero-Mock policy).
-   **Documentation**: 
    -   Manually walk through setup instructions in `README.md` and troubleshooting steps on different OS (if feasible) to verify accuracy.
    -   Check for clarity and completeness of explanations.

## 5. Documentation (Meta-Documentation for this Module)
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `docs/technical_overview.md`, and `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md` reflective of `env_checker.py`'s current functionality and the overall setup strategy.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `environment_setup`
-   **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure setup instructions and `env_checker.py` (as much as Python allows) are compatible with major developer platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).
-   **Clarity for Beginners**: The setup process is often a developer's first interaction with the project. Prioritize clarity and simple, actionable steps.
-   **Security First**: When guiding users on `.env` files or installing tools, always consider the security implications as outlined in `SECURITY.md`.

## 7. Final Check
-   Verify that `env_checker.py` runs correctly and provides the intended guidance.
-   Read through all documentation in this module to ensure it is consistent and accurate.
-   Update this module's `CHANGELOG.md` if significant changes were made to scripts or core documentation.
