# Cursor Rules for the static_analysis Module

## 0. Preamble
These rules are specific to the `static_analysis` module and supplement `general.cursorrules`. Always adhere to `general.cursorrules` unless explicitly overridden here for a specific reason pertinent to this module.

## 1. Module Purpose & Context
-   **Core Functionality**: This module analyzes source code without execution to enhance quality, identify bugs, enforce standards, and detect security vulnerabilities.
-   **Key Technologies/Tools**: Python, linters (Pylint, Flake8), type checkers (Pyrefly), security scanners (Bandit), code complexity analyzers, style checkers.
-   Refer to the module's main `README.md` for an overview.

## 2. Key Files & Structure in `static_analysis` Module
When working within this module, pay close attention to:
-   `README.md`: High-level overview, setup, and usage of the Static Analysis module.
-   `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: Details for programmatic interfaces (functions, classes) provided by this module.
-   `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: For tools exposed via Model Context Protocol from this module.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: All notable changes to this module must be logged here.
-   `SECURITY.md`: Specific security considerations for static analysis and vulnerability detection.
-   `pyproject.toml`: Python dependencies (managed centrally via uv).
-   `docs/`: In-depth documentation, technical overviews, and tutorials specific to Static Analysis.
-   `src/` (or primary Python package folders, e.g., `static_analysis/` itself if it contains Python sources directly): Core logic of the module.
-   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for this module.
-   `.gitignore`: Module-specific ignored files.
-   `static_analyzer.py`: Core static analysis functionality.
-   `pyrefly_runner.py`: Pyrefly type checker integration.

## 3. Coding Standards & Practices for `static_analysis`
-   **Consistency**: Adhere to existing coding styles, naming conventions, and architectural patterns found within the `static_analysis` module.
-   **Language Specifics**: Primarily Python. Follow PEP 8. Use type hinting extensively for analysis configurations and results.
-   **Analysis Accuracy**: Ensure static analysis tools provide accurate results with minimal false positives.
-   **Performance**: Optimize analysis execution for speed and resource efficiency.
-   **Multi-Language Support**: Support analysis for all languages used in the Codomyrmex ecosystem.

## 4. Testing in `static_analysis`
-   New features (e.g., new analysis tools, language support) or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by relevant tests in `tests/unit/` and/or `tests/integration/`.
-   Tests should cover various analysis scenarios, tool integrations, and result validation.
-   Use real external analysis tools with environment-gated tests for deterministic behavior (Zero-Mock policy).
-   Run existing tests to ensure no regressions. Refer to `static_analysis/tests/README.md`.

## 5. Documentation for `static_analysis`
-   Keep this module's `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` directory, and other relevant documentation files meticulously up-to-date.
-   Document analysis tools, configuration options, and interpretation of results clearly.
-   Include examples of analysis output and configuration files.

## 6. Specific Considerations for `static_analysis`
-   **Tool Integration**: When defining MCP tools, ensure `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` is precise regarding analysis parameters and output formats.
-   **Accuracy**: Maintain high accuracy in analysis results while minimizing false positives.
-   **Security Focus**: Prioritize security vulnerability detection and reporting.
-   **Performance**: Optimize analysis tools for CI/CD integration and large codebases.

## 7. Final Check for `static_analysis`
-   Before finalizing changes, ensure all module-specific documentation is updated.
-   Verify that all tests for this module pass.
-   Confirm that static analysis tools produce accurate results and integrate properly.
-   Test integration with related modules like `code_review` and `build_synthesis`.
