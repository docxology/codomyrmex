## Detailed Architecture and Implementation



### Design Principles
1.  **Strict Modularity**: Each component is isolated and communicates via well-defined APIs.
2.  **Performance Optimization**: Implementation leverages lazy loading and intelligent caching to minimize resource overhead.
3.  **Error Resilience**: Robust exception handling ensures system stability even under unexpected conditions.
4.  **Extensibility**: The architecture is designed to accommodate future enhancements without breaking existing contracts.

### Technical Implementation
The codebase utilizes modern Python features (version 3.10+) to provide a clean, type-safe API. Interaction patterns are documented in the corresponding `AGENTS.md` and `SPEC.md` files, ensuring that both human developers and automated agents can effectively utilize these capabilities.
