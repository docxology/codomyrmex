# Build Synthesis

## Overview

The Build Synthesis module is responsible for automating the build processes and synthesizing various artifacts within the Codomyrmex ecosystem. This includes compiling code, packaging components, generating necessary boilerplate or derived code, and ensuring that build outputs are correctly structured and managed. It aims to provide a consistent and reliable mechanism for constructing and assembling different parts of the project.

## Key Components

- **Build Script Orchestrator**: Manages and executes sequences of build tasks, potentially using tools like `make`, `doit`, or custom Python scripting for complex build logic.
- **Code Generation Utilities**: Tools or scripts for generating boilerplate code, data models, or other derived code artifacts from templates or specifications.
- **Artifact Packaging Tools**: Integrates with or implements mechanisms for packaging compiled code, libraries, and other resources into distributable formats (e.g., wheels, containers).
- **Configuration Management**: Handles build configurations for different environments or targets.
- **Dependency Resolution Logic**: Potentially includes tools to analyze or ensure consistency of dependencies across different parts of the project during the build process.

## Integration Points

This module is central to the development lifecycle and interacts with various parts of Codomyrmex:

- **Provides:**
    - **Compiled Artifacts**: Delivers compiled code, libraries, or executables for other modules or for deployment.
    - **Packaged Components**: Produces packaged versions of modules or the entire project (e.g., Python wheels, Docker images).
    - **Generated Code**: Creates boilerplate code, data structures, or other derived code based on templates or specifications, which are then used by other modules.
    - **Build Status & Logs**: Information about the success or failure of build processes, along with logs, often integrated with the `logging_monitoring` module and potentially CI/CD systems.
    - **MCP Tools**: May expose tools like `trigger_build` or `synthesize_code_component` (see `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`).

- **Consumes:**
    - **Source Code**: Takes source code from various project modules as input for compilation and packaging.
    - **`static_analysis` module**: May run static analysis checks (linting, security scans) as a pre-build step to ensure code quality before proceeding with the build.
    - **`code_execution_sandbox` module**: If build steps involve executing untrusted scripts or tools, it might leverage the sandbox for secure execution.
    - **`logging_monitoring` module**: For logging build activities, progress, and errors.
    - **`model_context_protocol` module**: If exposing tools like `trigger_build`, it will adhere to MCP for their definition.
    - **Configuration Files**: Build scripts, Makefiles, Dockerfiles, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, etc., that define how components are built and packaged.

- Refer to the [API Specification](API_SPECIFICATION.md) and [MCP Tool Specification](MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md) for detailed programmatic interfaces.)

## Getting Started

To use the Build Synthesis module, first ensure your overall Codomyrmex development environment is set up as per `environment_setup/README.md`.

Usage of this module typically involves:
1.  **Defining Build Targets/Recipes**: Configure build scripts (e.g., Makefiles, `pyproject.toml`, custom Python scripts) that specify how components are compiled, tested, and packaged.
2.  **Executing Build Commands**: Running the defined build commands from the command line (e.g., `make build`, `python setup.py build`).
3.  **Code/Artifact Generation**: If the module includes code synthesis tools, these might be invoked via scripts or through its API/MCP tools (like `synthesize_code_component`).
4.  **Output Verification**: Checking the `output/` directory or other designated locations for the generated artifacts.

Specific instructions for triggering builds or using synthesis features will be detailed in the `docs/tutorials/` and `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md` for this module.

### Prerequisites

- **Development Environment**: A fully set up Codomyrmex development environment as per `environment_setup/README.md`.
- **Build Tools**: Depending on the project's needs, this might include:
    - `make`
    - `Docker`
    - Language-specific build tools (e.g., Python's `pip`, `setuptools`, `build`; Node.js's `npm` or `yarn`; Java's `Maven` or `Gradle`).
    - Templating engines if used for code synthesis (e.g., Jinja2 for Python).
- **Dependencies**: This module relies on dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (and potentially the root `requirements.txt`). Ensure these are installed.

### Installation

This module is a core part of the Codomyrmex project. No separate installation is required beyond setting up the main project.

1.  **Clone the Repository**: If not already done:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codomyrmex/codomyrmex.git
    cd codomyrmex
    ```
2.  **Set up Environment**: Follow instructions in `environment_setup/README.md`.
    ```bash
    # Example commands (adapt based on environment_setup)
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r build_synthesis/requirements.txt # If it has specific deps
    ```

### Configuration

- **Build Scripts**: Configuration for build processes is primarily managed through build scripts such as Makefiles, `pyproject.toml` (for Python projects using PEP 517/518), Dockerfiles, or custom build orchestration scripts (e.g., Python scripts using `subprocess` or libraries like `doit`).
- **Template Locations**: If using code synthesis from templates, the paths to these templates (likely within the `template/` directory) need to be known by the synthesis tools.
- **Output Directories**: While tools might suggest default output paths (e.g., within `output/builds/`), these can often be configured via parameters or environment variables.
- **MCP Tool Parameters**: When using MCP tools like `trigger_build` or `synthesize_code_component`, refer to `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` for configurable input parameters.

## Development

Contributions to this module should focus on enhancing automation, improving the reliability of build processes, and expanding code synthesis capabilities.

### Code Structure

The `build_synthesis` module typically contains:
- `README.md`: This file.
- `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: For any direct APIs (currently a template).
- `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: Defines MCP tools like `trigger_build` and `synthesize_code_component`.
- `requirements.txt`: Module-specific Python dependencies.
- Source code for build orchestration, script execution, or template processing (e.g., in Python files directly under `build_synthesis/` or a `src/` subdirectory).
- `docs/`: Detailed documentation including technical overviews and tutorials.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for build scripts and synthesis logic.

For a more detailed architectural view, see the [Technical Overview](./docs/technical_overview.md).

### Building & Testing

- **Building Components**: The primary function of this module is to *perform* builds. Therefore, "building" this module itself usually means ensuring its scripts and tools are executable and correctly configured.
- **Testing Build Logic**: 
    - Create test projects or mock file structures to validate that build scripts compile/package them correctly.
    - Test code generation tools by providing sample specifications/templates and verifying the output against expected code structures.
- **Running Tests**: Execute tests using the project's test runner (e.g., `pytest`). Refer to `build_synthesis/tests/README.md` for specific instructions.
    ```bash
    # Example using pytest (adapt as needed)
    pytest build_synthesis/tests/unit
    pytest build_synthesis/tests/integration
    ```
    - Unit tests should focus on isolated pieces of logic (e.g., a function that processes a template).
    - Integration tests might involve running actual (small-scale) build commands or synthesis tasks on sample inputs and verifying the artifacts produced in a controlled environment.

Adherence to project coding standards and `.cursorrules` is expected.
