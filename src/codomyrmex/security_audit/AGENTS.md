# Codomyrmex Agents — src/codomyrmex/security_audit

**Version**: v0.1.0 | **Status**: Active | **Last Updated**: January 2025

## Purpose
Security audit agents performing comprehensive security analysis, vulnerability assessment, certificate validation, and encryption management for applications and infrastructure.

## Active Components
- `certificate_validator.py` – X.509 certificate validation and SSL/TLS security assessment
- `encryption_manager.py` – Cryptographic operations and key management system
- `__init__.py` – Package initialization and security utilities exports
- `README.md` – Comprehensive security documentation and usage guides

## Operating Contracts
- Maintain alignment between code, documentation, and configured workflows.
- Ensure Model Context Protocol interfaces remain available for sibling agents.
- Record outcomes in shared telemetry and update TODO queues when necessary.
- Security scanning maintains zero false positives while ensuring comprehensive coverage.
- Certificate validation follows current industry standards and compliance requirements.
- Encryption operations use approved algorithms and maintain key security best practices.
