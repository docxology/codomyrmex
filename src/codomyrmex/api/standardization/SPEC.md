# api_standardization - Functional Specification

**Version**: v0.1.0 | **Status**: Active | **Last Updated**: January 2026

## Purpose
Provides the framework for building REST and GraphQL APIs. It enforces consistency in routing, middleware, and documentation (OpenAPI).

## Design Principles
- **Contract First**: APIs are defined by schemas (`openapi_generator.py`).
- **Composition**: Middleware pipelines for cross-cutting concerns (Auth, Logging).

## Functional Requirements
1.  **REST**: Routing and request handling.
2.  **GraphQL**: Schema definition and resolution.
3.  **Versioning**: Semantic versioning support.

## Interface Contracts
- `create_api`: Factory for API instances.
- `APIResponse`: Standardized envelop for HTTP responses.

## Navigation
- **Human Documentation**: [README.md](README.md)
- **Technical Documentation**: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
- **Parent**: [../SPEC.md](../SPEC.md)

## Detailed Architecture and Implementation

The implementation of this component follows the core principles of the Codomyrmex ecosystem: modularity, performance, and reliability. By adhering to standardized interfaces, this module ensures seamless integration with the broader platform.

### Design Principles
1.  **Strict Modularity**: Each component is isolated and communicates via well-defined APIs.
2.  **Performance Optimization**: Implementation leverages lazy loading and intelligent caching to minimize resource overhead.
3.  **Error Resilience**: Robust exception handling ensures system stability even under unexpected conditions.
4.  **Extensibility**: The architecture is designed to accommodate future enhancements without breaking existing contracts.

### Technical Implementation
The codebase utilizes modern Python features (version 3.10+) to provide a clean, type-safe API. Interaction patterns are documented in the corresponding `AGENTS.md` and `SPEC.md` files, ensuring that both human developers and automated agents can effectively utilize these capabilities.
