## Security Architecture

### Core Security Principles

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: All components operate with minimal required permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls protect against various attack vectors
3. **Fail Secure**: System fails to a secure state when encountering errors
4. **Secure by Default**: Default configurations prioritize security over convenience
5. **Audit Everything**: All security-relevant operations are logged and auditable

### Component Security

#### Orchestration Engine
- **Session Isolation**: Each orchestration session operates in isolated context
- **Resource Quotas**: Strict limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- **Input Validation**: All parameters are validated and sanitized
- **Timeout Protection**: All operations have configurable timeouts
- **Event Handler Security**: Event handlers are validated and sandboxed

#### Workflow Manager
- **Workflow Validation**: All workflow definitions are validated before execution
- **Parameter Sanitization**: Workflow parameters are sanitized to prevent injection
- **Execution Isolation**: Workflows execute in isolated environments
- **Step Validation**: Each workflow step is validated before execution
- **Result Validation**: Step results are validated before being passed to subsequent steps

#### Task Orchestrator
- **Task Isolation**: Tasks execute in separate, isolated contexts
- **Resource Constraints**: Tasks are constrained by allocated resource limits
- **Dependency Validation**: Task dependencies are validated to prevent circular dependencies
- **Input Sanitization**: All task inputs are sanitized and validated
- **Output Filtering**: Task outputs are filtered to remove sensitive information

#### Project Manager
- **Path Validation**: All project paths are validated and restricted to safe directories
- **Template Security**: Project templates are validated for malicious content
- **Configuration Security**: Project configurations are validated and encrypted when necessary
- **Access Control**: Project access is controlled through permission systems
- **File Permissions**: Created files have appropriate security permissions

#### Resource Manager
- **Allocation Limits**: Resource allocations are subject to strict limits and quotas
- **Access Control**: Resource access is controlled through authentication and authorization
- **Usage Monitoring**: Resource usage is continuously monitored for anomalies
- **Cleanup Mechanisms**: Automatic cleanup prevents resource leaks
- **Isolation**: Resources are isolated between different users and sessions

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Workflow Security
- **Validate Inputs**: Always validate inputs to workflows and tasks
- **Minimize Permissions**: Use the minimum required permissions for operations
- **Secure Parameters**: Never include sensitive information in workflow parameters
- **Review Templates**: Review workflow and project templates before use
- **Monitor Execution**: Monitor workflow execution for unexpected behavior

#### Project Security
- **Secure Storage**: Store projects in secure directories with appropriate permissions
- **Configuration Security**: Encrypt sensitive configuration data
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls for multi-user environments
- **Regular Updates**: Keep templates and configurations updated
- **Backup Security**: Secure project backups and archives

#### Resource Security
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate resource limits for tasks and workflows
- **Monitor Usage**: Regularly monitor resource usage for anomalies
- **Clean Up**: Properly clean up resources after use
- **Access Control**: Restrict resource access to authorized users only
- **Audit Logs**: Review resource allocation logs regularly

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs at module boundaries
- **Output Sanitization**: Sanitize outputs to prevent information disclosure
- **Error Handling**: Implement secure error handling that doesn't leak information
- **Logging Security**: Ensure logs don't contain sensitive information
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated and audit for vulnerabilities

#### API Security
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication for API access
- **Authorization**: Enforce authorization checks for all operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: Validate all API inputs thoroughly
- **Output Filtering**: Filter API outputs to prevent information disclosure

### Mitigations

#### Input Validation and Sanitization
```python
# Example: Workflow parameter validation
def validate_workflow_parameters(params: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Validate and sanitize workflow parameters."""
    validated = {}
    for key, value in params.items():
        # Validate parameter name
        if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$', key):
            raise ValidationError(f"Invalid parameter name: {key}")
        
        # Sanitize string values
        if isinstance(value, str):
            # Remove potentially dangerous characters
            value = re.sub(r'[;&|`$]', '', value)
            # Limit length
            value = value[:1000]
        
        validated[key] = value
    
    return validated
```

#### Resource Limits and Quotas
```python
# Example: Resource allocation with limits
resource_limits = {
    'cpu_cores': 8,
    'memory_gb': 16,
    'disk_gb': 100,
    'execution_time': 3600,  # 1 hour
    'max_files': 10000
}

def allocate_with_limits(requirements: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """Allocate resources with security limits."""
    for resource, amount in requirements.items():
        if amount > resource_limits.get(resource, 0):
            raise ResourceLimitError(f"Requested {resource} exceeds limit")
    
    return allocate_resources(requirements)
```

#### Secure Path Validation
```python
# Example: Secure path validation
import os
from pathlib import Path

def validate_project_path(path: str, base_dir: str) -> Path:
    """Validate project path for security."""
    # Resolve path and ensure it's within base directory
    resolved = Path(path).resolve()
    base = Path(base_dir).resolve()
    
    # Check if path is within base directory
    try:
        resolved.relative_to(base)
    except ValueError:
        raise SecurityError("Path outside allowed directory")
    
    # Additional security checks
    if any(part.startswith('.') for part in resolved.parts):
        raise SecurityError("Hidden directories not allowed")
    
    return resolved
```
