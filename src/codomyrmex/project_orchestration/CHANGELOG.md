## Development Notes

### Version 1.0.0 Features

The initial release includes a complete project orchestration system with the following key capabilities:

#### Workflow Management
- Define complex multi-step workflows with dependencies
- Support for conditional execution based on previous results
- Parallel execution of independent workflow steps
- Parameter passing between workflow steps using template syntax
- Workflow templates for common patterns (AI analysis, build/test, data processing)

#### Task Orchestration
- Priority-based task queuing system
- Automatic dependency resolution and execution ordering
- Resource allocation and constraint satisfaction
- Retry mechanisms with configurable policies
- Task result caching and reuse

#### Project Management
- Project templates with directory structure and configuration
- Project lifecycle tracking with milestones and metrics
- Configuration management with environment-specific settings
- Archive and restoration capabilities
- Multi-project workspace management

#### Resource Management
- System resource discovery and inventory
- Dynamic resource allocation with quotas and limits
- Resource utilization monitoring and optimization
- Cleanup and garbage collection of expired allocations
- Health monitoring and capacity planning

#### Integration Architecture
- Unified interface to all Codomyrmex modules
- Event-driven architecture with customizable handlers
- Session management for context preservation
- Performance monitoring with detailed metrics
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Breaking Changes from Pre-release
- None (initial release)

### Deprecated Features
- None (initial release)

### Migration Guide
- This is the initial release, no migration required

### Known Issues
- Resource allocation may be suboptimal under high contention
- Long-running workflows may experience session timeout
- Large project templates may slow initial project creation

### Planned Features for v1.1.0
- Workflow visualization and monitoring dashboard
- Advanced scheduling algorithms with machine learning
- Integration with external orchestration systems (Airflow, Kubernetes)
- Workflow versioning and rollback capabilities
- Real-time collaboration features for multi-user projects
- Advanced analytics and reporting capabilities

### Performance Benchmarks (v1.0.0)
- Workflow execution overhead: < 100ms for simple workflows
- Task orchestration latency: < 10ms per task
- Resource allocation time: < 50ms for standard resources
- Project creation time: < 2s for standard templates
- Memory usage: < 100MB for typical orchestration workloads
- Concurrent workflow limit: 100+ workflows depending on resources

### Security Considerations
- All external inputs are validated and sanitized
- Resource access is controlled through quota systems
- Workflow execution is isolated in secure environments
- Sensitive configuration data is encrypted at rest
- Audit logs are maintained for compliance requirements
