  Documentation generation patterns: RASP compliance, API specs,
  docstring standards, and architecture decision records.

patterns:
  - name: rasp_coverage
    description: >
      Every module must have README.md, AGENTS.md, SPEC.md, and PAI.md
      at its root directory level.
    files:
      - README.md
      - AGENTS.md
      - SPEC.md
      - PAI.md

  - name: docstring_format
    description: Use Google-style docstrings with Args, Returns, and Raises.
    example: |
      def fetch_data(url: str, timeout: int = 30) -> dict:
          """Fetch JSON data from a remote endpoint.

          Args:
              url: The endpoint URL to fetch from.
              timeout: Request timeout in seconds.

          Returns:
              Parsed JSON response as a dictionary.

          Raises:
              ConnectionError: If the endpoint is unreachable.
              ValueError: If the response is not valid JSON.
          """

  - name: changelog_entry
    description: Every version bump must have a CHANGELOG.md entry.

anti_patterns:
  - name: stale_docs
    why_bad: Documentation that doesn't match code is worse than no docs.
    example: |
      # Bad — docstring says 2 params, function has 3
      def process(a, b, c):
          """Process two values."""

  - name: placeholder_docs
    why_bad: TODO and FIXME in shipped docs confuse users.

validations:
  - "All public classes and functions have docstrings"
  - "README.md exists at module root"
  - "API_SPECIFICATION.md matches actual function signatures"

sharp_edges:
  - "Auto-generated docs that aren't reviewed"
  - "Version numbers in docs that drift from pyproject.toml"
  - "Links to internal paths that break on GitHub"
