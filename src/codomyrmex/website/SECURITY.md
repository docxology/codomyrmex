# Security Policy for Standard Implementation Details

This document outlines security procedures and policies for the Standard Implementation Details module.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this module, please report it to us as soon as possible.
We take all security reports seriously.

**DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please email Standard Implementation Details with the subject line: "SECURITY Vulnerability Report: Standard Implementation Details - Standard Implementation Details".
<!-- IMPORTANT: When using this template for a new module, replace Standard Implementation Details and Standard Implementation Details above. Ensure the email is appropriate for security disclosures. -->

Please include the following information in your report:

- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any specific configurations or conditions required.
- Any proof-of-concept code or examples.

- Your name and contact information (optional).

We aim to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within [Specify Expected Response Time, e.g., 2-3 business days] and will work with you to understand and remediate the issue. We may request additional information if needed.

Public disclosure of the vulnerability will be coordinated with you after the vulnerability has been fixed and an update is available, or after a reasonable period if a fix is not immediately possible.
