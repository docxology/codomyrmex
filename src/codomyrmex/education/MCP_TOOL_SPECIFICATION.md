# Education - MCP Tool Specification

This document outlines the specification for tools within the Education module that are intended to be integrated with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Current Status: No MCP Tools Defined

The Education module provides adaptive learning platform capabilities for internal use by other Codomyrmex modules, including curriculum generation, tutoring, and certification. These functions are primarily for programmatic integration within the application lifecycle and are not suited for exposure as Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools.

MCP tools are typically designed for discrete, invocable actions or queries that an external agent (like an LLM) would trigger. The internal adaptive learning mechanisms do not fit this paradigm.

If future enhancements to this module introduce features that are appropriate for MCP (e.g., generating a curriculum for a given topic, or querying certification status for a learner), this document will be updated accordingly.

For details on how to use the education functionalities within your Python code, please refer to the module's `README.md` and `API_SPECIFICATION.md`.
