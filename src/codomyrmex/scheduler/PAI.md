# Personal AI Context - Scheduler

## Role in PAI Stack

The scheduler enables autonomous agent operation by providing:

- **Self-maintenance**: Agents can schedule their own cleanup/optimization tasks
- **Periodic learning**: Schedule knowledge base updates
- **Health checks**: Regular self-diagnostics

## Autonomy Considerations

- Jobs can be created by agents themselves
- Supports dynamic scheduling based on agent needs
- Error recovery via automatic rescheduling
