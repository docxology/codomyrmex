**Version**: v0.1.0 | **Status**: Active | **Last Updated**: January 2025

## Purpose
Advanced Git automation agents providing comprehensive repository management, workflow orchestration, GitHub integration, and collaborative development tooling.

## Active Components
- `docs/` – Comprehensive documentation for Git workflows and automation
- `tests/` – Test suites validating Git operations and automation reliability

## Operating Contracts
- Maintain alignment between code, documentation, and configured workflows.
- Ensure Model Context Protocol interfaces remain available for sibling agents.
- Record outcomes in shared telemetry and update TODO queues when necessary.
- Git operations maintain repository integrity and handle merge conflicts gracefully.
- Automation workflows preserve commit history and maintain proper attribution.
- GitHub integration maintains API compatibility and handles rate limiting appropriately.

## Related Modules
- **Project Orchestration** (`project_orchestration/`) - Coordinates multi-step development workflows
- **CI/CD Automation** (`ci_cd_automation/`) - Manages deployment pipelines and releases
- **Build Synthesis** (`build_synthesis/`) - Handles build processes and artifact generation

## Checkpoints
- [ ] Confirm AGENTS.md reflects the current module purpose.
- [ ] Verify logging and telemetry hooks for this directory's agents.
- [ ] Sync automation scripts or TODO entries after modifications.
