# 3D Modeling Module Architecture

## Overview

The 3D Modeling module provides comprehensive 3D graphics, rendering, and AR/VR/XR capabilities for the Codomyrmex platform.

## Architecture Components

### Core Engine (`engine_3d.py`)
- **Scene3D**: Main container for 3D scenes
- **Object3D**: Individual 3D objects with transform and geometry
- **Camera3D**: Camera system for viewing scenes
- **Light3D**: Lighting system for realistic rendering
- **Material3D**: Surface properties and textures

### AR/VR/XR Support (`ar_vr_support.py`)
- **ARSession**: Augmented Reality tracking and world understanding
- **VRRenderer**: Stereo rendering for VR headsets
- **XRInterface**: Unified interface for extended reality experiences

### Rendering Pipeline (`rendering_pipeline.py`)
- **RenderPipeline**: Main rendering coordinator
- **ShaderManager**: GLSL shader program management
- **TextureManager**: 2D texture resource management

## Design Principles

### 1. Modularity
Each component is designed as an independent module that can be used separately or combined for complex applications.

### 2. Performance
Optimized for real-time rendering with efficient memory management and GPU utilization.

### 3. Extensibility
Plugin architecture allows for easy addition of new rendering techniques, file formats, and platform support.

### 4. Cross-Platform
Designed to work across different operating systems and graphics APIs.

## Data Flow

```
Input Data → Scene Setup → Transform Objects → Lighting → Rendering → Output
     ↓           ↓            ↓            ↓         ↓          ↓
  File I/O   Scene3D      Object3D     Light3D   RenderPipeline   Display

```

## Integration Points

### With Codomyrmex Platform
- Uses platform logging and configuration systems
- Integrates with data visualization module for 3D data representation
- Leverages project orchestration for complex multi-step 3D workflows

### External Dependencies
- OpenGL for hardware-accelerated rendering
- NumPy for efficient mathematical operations
- Platform-specific AR/VR SDKs (ARKit, ARCore, OpenXR)

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Texture atlasing to reduce GPU memory usage
- Level-of-detail (LOD) system for distant objects

### Rendering Optimization
- Frustum culling to avoid rendering off-screen objects
- Occlusion culling for complex scenes
- Instanced rendering for repeated geometry

### Platform-Specific Optimizations
- Mobile GPU optimizations for AR applications
- VR-specific rendering techniques for 60+ FPS requirements
- Desktop optimizations for complex CAD models

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Advanced physics simulation (rigid body, soft body, fluids)
- AI-powered content generation
- Real-time collaboration features
- Cloud-based rendering for complex scenes
- Integration with external 3D software (Blender, Maya, etc.)

### Research Areas
- Machine learning for 3D reconstruction
- Procedural content generation
- Real-time global illumination
- Advanced material systems (PBR, subsurface scattering)
