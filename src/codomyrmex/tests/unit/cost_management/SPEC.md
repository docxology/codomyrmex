# Codomyrmex Root Specification

## Purpose
This specification formally defines the expected behavior, interfaces, and architecture for the `Codomyrmex Root` module.

## Architectural Constraints
- **Modularity**: Components must maintain strict modular boundaries.
- **Real Execution**: The design guarantees executable paths without reliance on stubbed or mocked data.
- **Data Integrity**: All input and output signatures must be strictly validated.
