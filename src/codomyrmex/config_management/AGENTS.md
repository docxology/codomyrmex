- Ensure Model Context Protocol interfaces remain available for sibling agents.
- Record outcomes in shared telemetry and update TODO queues when necessary.

## Checkpoints
- [ ] Confirm AGENTS.md reflects the current module purpose.
- [ ] Verify logging and telemetry hooks for this directory's agents.
- [ ] Sync automation scripts or TODO entries after modifications.
