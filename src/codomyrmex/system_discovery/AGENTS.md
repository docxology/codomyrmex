# Codomyrmex Agents — src/codomyrmex/system_discovery

**Version**: v0.1.0 | **Status**: Active | **Last Updated**: January 2025

## Purpose
System introspection agents automatically discovering, cataloging, and mapping system resources, capabilities, dependencies, and configurations across development and production environments.

## Active Components
- `capability_scanner.py` – Advanced system capability detection and resource mapping engine
- `API_SPECIFICATION.md` – Comprehensive API documentation for discovery interfaces
- `README.md` – System discovery guides and capability mapping documentation
- `__init__.py` – Package initialization and system discovery utilities exports

## Operating Contracts
- Maintain alignment between code, documentation, and configured workflows.
- Ensure Model Context Protocol interfaces remain available for sibling agents.
- Record outcomes in shared telemetry and update TODO queues when necessary.
- System discovery maintains accurate capability mapping without disrupting system operations.
- Resource detection provides comprehensive coverage while respecting privacy and security boundaries.
- Dependency analysis maintains up-to-date relationship mappings for optimal system orchestration.

## Related Modules
- **Environment Setup** (`environment_setup/`) - Provides environment configuration for discovery
- **Configuration Management** (`config_management/`) - Manages discovered system settings
- **Project Orchestration** (`project_orchestration/`) - Uses discovery data for workflow optimization

## Checkpoints
- [ ] Confirm AGENTS.md reflects the current module purpose.
- [ ] Verify logging and telemetry hooks for this directory's agents.
- [ ] Sync automation scripts or TODO entries after modifications.
