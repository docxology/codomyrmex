# Codomyrmex Agents — src/codomyrmex/performance

**Version**: v0.1.0 | **Status**: Active | **Last Updated**: January 2025

## Purpose
Performance optimization agents providing intelligent caching, lazy loading, benchmarking, and runtime performance monitoring to enhance application responsiveness and resource efficiency.

## Active Components
- `cache_manager.py` – Multi-tier caching system with intelligent cache invalidation and memory management
- `lazy_loader.py` – On-demand resource loading with predictive preloading capabilities
- `__init__.py` – Package initialization and performance utilities exports
- `README.md` – Performance optimization guides and benchmarking documentation

## Operating Contracts
- Maintain alignment between code, documentation, and configured workflows.
- Ensure Model Context Protocol interfaces remain available for sibling agents.
- Record outcomes in shared telemetry and update TODO queues when necessary.
- Performance optimizations maintain application correctness while improving responsiveness.
- Caching strategies balance memory usage with hit rate optimization.
- Benchmarking provides accurate measurements without significantly impacting performance.

## Related Modules
- **Data Visualization** (`data_visualization/`) - Creates performance dashboards and metrics visualization
- **Logging & Monitoring** (`logging_monitoring/`) - Provides performance logging and alerting
- **Project Orchestration** (`project_orchestration/`) - Coordinates performance testing workflows

## Checkpoints
- [ ] Confirm AGENTS.md reflects the current module purpose.
- [ ] Verify logging and telemetry hooks for this directory's agents.
- [ ] Sync automation scripts or TODO entries after modifications.
