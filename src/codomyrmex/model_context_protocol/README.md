# Model Context Protocol

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a foundational specification within the Codomyrmex ecosystem, designed to standardize communication and interaction between AI models (particularly Large Language Models - LLMs), autonomous AI agents, and a diverse suite of software tools.

**Purpose of MCP:**

1.  **Interoperability**: To enable seamless interaction between different AI models/agents and various functional modules (tools) by defining a common language and structure for requests and responses.
2.  **Tool Discovery and Invocation**: To provide a consistent way for AI agents to discover available tools, understand their capabilities (inputs, outputs, behavior), and invoke them reliably.
3.  **Contextual Data Exchange**: To facilitate the structured exchange of necessary contextual information that tools might require to perform their tasks effectively and that AI models need to generate relevant and accurate responses or actions.
4.  **Standardization**: To enforce a unified approach across the Codomyrmex project for exposing module functionalities as "tools" that AI agents can leverage, promoting modularity and reusability.

MCP achieves this by defining:
- Standardized schemas for tool invocation requests (how an agent asks a tool to do something).
- Standardized schemas for tool execution results (how a tool reports back to the agent).
- Guidelines for specifying tool capabilities, including parameters, expected inputs/outputs, and descriptions.
- A framework for versioning and managing the evolution of tools and the protocol itself.

This module, `model_context_protocol`, serves as the central authority for these definitions. It provides the blueprints that all other Codomyrmex modules must follow when they intend to expose their functionalities as MCP-compliant tools.

## Core MCP Concepts

Understanding MCP involves a few key concepts:

-   **AI Agent**: An intelligent system (often powered by an LLM) that can perceive its environment (including available tools and context), make decisions, and take actions by invoking tools.
-   **Tool**: A specific function, API endpoint, or capability provided by a Codomyrmex module that an AI agent can invoke to perform a task (e.g., `ai_code_editing.generate_code_snippet`, `code_execution_sandbox.execute_code`).
-   **Tool Call / Invocation**: An MCP-formatted message sent by an AI agent to a tool, specifying the tool's name and the arguments required for its execution. The structure of this call is defined by the tool's `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`.
-   **Tool Result / Response**: An MCP-formatted message sent back by a tool to the AI agent after execution, containing the outcome (success, failure, data), any generated outputs, and potential error information. The structure of this result is also defined by the tool's `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`.
-   **`MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`**: A crucial document *within each module that exposes tools*. It meticulously describes each tool's purpose, invocation name, input schema (parameters), output schema (return values), error handling, idempotency, usage examples, and security considerations, all conforming to the meta-specification provided by *this* `model_context_protocol` module.
-   **Contextual Information**: Data provided to the AI agent or to a tool to help it perform its task. This could include source code, user queries, previous conversation history, or environment details. MCP aims to provide guidelines for structuring this information when relevant to tool calls.

## Key Components of This Module

This `model_context_protocol` module primarily provides specifications and templates, rather than directly executable code for AI agents. Its key components are:

-   **Protocol Specification Documents**: This `README.md`, the `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` (meta-specification) within this module, and detailed guides in `docs/` that collectively define the MCP.
-   **Schema Definitions**: Abstract definitions for core data structures and message formats (e.g., for tool calls and results). These are typically described using JSON Schema principles in the meta-specification.
-   **`MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` Meta-Specification**: The authoritative document (`./MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`) within *this* module. It serves as a **template and a set of rules** that other Codomyrmex modules MUST follow when creating their *own* `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` files to describe their tools.
-   **Canonical Tool Specification Template File**: The actual template file located at `template/module_template/MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`. This is the starting point for other modules to document their tools.
-   **Validation Logic (Conceptual/Guidance)**: While this module might not provide a universal validation library, it specifies how validation should occur (e.g., using JSON Schema) and may recommend tools or libraries (like `jsonschema`, listed in this module's `requirements.txt` for potential example validators).
-   **Versioning Strategy Documentation**: Guidelines and best practices for versioning the MCP itself and individual tools to manage evolution and maintain compatibility.
-   **Serialization/Deserialization Guidelines**: Recommendations or standards for how MCP messages should be serialized (e.g., to JSON) for transmission.

## Integration Points

This module is foundational and defines how other modules interact with AI agents and tools:

- **Provides:**
    - **The Model Context Protocol Standard**: A comprehensive set of rules, schema guidelines, and interaction patterns for communication between AI models/agents and tools within Codomyrmex.
    - **The `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` Meta-Specification and Template**: Authoritative guidelines and the canonical template (`template/module_template/MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`) that all other modules use to define their tool interfaces for MCP compatibility.
    - **Standardization Framework**: Enforces a common, consistent way for modules to expose their functionalities as tools consumable by AI agents, promoting modularity and reusability across the Codomyrmex project.

- **Consumes:**
    - **`logging_monitoring` module**: For any logging performed by potential example implementations or utility scripts developed within this module (if any, e.g., a reference schema validator).
    - **Schema Validation Libraries** (e.g., `jsonschema` as listed in `model_context_protocol/requirements.txt`): May be used internally if this module provides utilities for schema validation or for validating example MCP messages against defined structures.
    - (Indirectly) **All other Codomyrmex modules exposing tools**: Its primary purpose is to be adopted by other modules. These modules become "consumers" of the protocol's standards by structuring their tool definitions and interactions according to MCP.

- Refer to the [API Specification](API_SPECIFICATION.md) (if this module exposes any utility functions programmatically, such as a reference validator) and its own [MCP Tool Specification](MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md) (which, critically, defines the meta-specification and guiding principles for how *other* modules should write their tool specifications) for detailed information.

## Getting Started with MCP (For Tool Developers & Consumers)

To understand, implement, or utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) within the Codomyrmex project, developers should:

1.  **Understand the Purpose**: Review the "Overview" and "Core MCP Concepts" sections of this README and the `docs/technical_overview.md` (once developed) to grasp the fundamental ideas of MCP and its role in AI agent-tool interaction.
2.  **Review the Meta-Specification**: Carefully read the `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` file located in *this* module's root directory. It explains the rules, expected structure, and key principles for how other modules must define their MCP tools.
3.  **Use the Canonical Template**: The primary resource for defining new tools in your own module is the template file located at `template/module_template/MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`. This template **must** be copied into your module and meticulously filled out according to the meta-specification guidelines from *this* module.
4.  **Examine Existing Implementations**: Look at the `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` files in other Codomyrmex modules (e.g., `ai_code_editing`, `data_visualization`, `code_execution_sandbox`) to see concrete examples of how various tools are defined and documented following the MCP standard.
5.  **Schema Definitions**: Familiarize yourself with the expected JSON structures for tool calls (input arguments) and tool responses (output schema), as outlined in the canonical template and demonstrated in existing examples.

This module itself does not typically require direct "installation" or "running" in the traditional sense, as its main output is the protocol specification, guidelines, and templates for other modules to follow.

### Prerequisites for Understanding/Developing MCP Specifications

- Familiarity with JSON and ideally JSON Schema for understanding tool input/output definitions.
- General understanding of how AI models (like LLMs) interact with external tools or functions.
- For contributing to this `model_context_protocol` module itself (e.g., updating the meta-specification, canonical template, or schema guidelines), a Python environment with `jsonschema` (see `model_context_protocol/requirements.txt`) would be needed for any validation examples or utilities.

### Installation of this Module (Conceptual)

This module is a core part of the Codomyrmex project. Cloning the main repository makes its specifications and templates available. No module-specific installation steps are typically required to *use* the protocol specifications in other modules, beyond adhering to the defined standards.

### Configuration for this Module

No specific runtime configuration is typically required for this module, as it primarily provides specification documents and templates. Other modules implementing MCP tools will have their own configuration requirements.

## Development of the `model_context_protocol` Module Itself

Contributions to *this* module typically involve refining the protocol specifications, updating the meta-specification (`MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` in this directory), improving the canonical tool template (`template/module_template/MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`), or adding examples and utilities related to the protocol (e.g., schema validators, example message generators).

### Code Structure

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of MCP and guidance for developers.
- `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: The **meta-specification** within this module, defining how other Codomyrmex modules must structure their own tool specification documents.
- `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: (Placeholder, potentially for utility functions like schema validators) For any Python utility functions this module might offer.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies like `jsonschema` if this module includes Python-based validation utilities or examples.
- `docs/`: Contains more detailed documentation about the protocol itself:
    - `technical_overview.md`: (To be developed) Will detail the design rationale, versioning strategy, and core schema elements of MCP in more depth.
    - `tutorials/`: (To be developed) Will offer tutorials on how to design, implement, and consume MCP-compliant tools.
- `template/module_template/MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: The crucial canonical template for other modules.
- `tests/`: (Placeholder) Would contain tests for any utility functions or validation logic provided by this module (e.g., testing a schema validator against example tool specs).

### Building & Testing (for this module's utilities)

- **Building**: If this module provides Python utilities (e.g., schema validation scripts), no separate build step is typically required beyond having a Python environment with dependencies from `model_context_protocol/requirements.txt` installed.
- **Testing**: If utility scripts or validation logic are part of this module:
    1.  **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r model_context_protocol/requirements.txt` (and project root `requirements.txt`).
    2.  **Run Tests**: Using `pytest` from the project root:
        ```bash
        pytest model_context_protocol/tests/
        ```
        Tests would focus on validating the functionality of any provided utilities (e.g., ensuring schema validation tools correctly identify valid/invalid MCP messages based on defined schemas).

Ensure any changes to the protocol specifications, templates, or guidelines are clearly documented and versioned appropriately (see `CHANGELOG.md` and the protocol's versioning strategy).
