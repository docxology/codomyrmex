# Environment Setup Module - Python Requirements

# This file is for listing Python package dependencies required *specifically* by the
# `environment_setup` module (e.g., for `env_checker.py`) that are NOT already
# covered by the main Codomyrmex project's root `requirements.txt` file.

# Currently, Python scripts within this module (like `env_checker.py`) rely on:
# 1. Python's standard library (e.g., `sys`, `os`).
# 2. Packages listed in the main project's root `requirements.txt` (e.g., `kit` from `cased-kit`, `python-dotenv`).

# If this module were to develop helper scripts requiring additional Python dependencies
# not present in the root `requirements.txt`, those unique dependencies should be listed below,
# ensuring to pin exact versions.
# Example:
# specific-env-setup-helper-lib==1.0.0

# As of now, there are no unique Python dependencies for this module to list here.
