# scripts - Specification

**Version**: v0.1.0 | **Status**: Active | **Last Updated**: February 2026

## Purpose

Utility scripts for setting up and managing development environments.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Idempotency**: Scripts should be safe to run multiple times.
2. **Platform**: Support both macOS (zsh) and Linux (bash) where possible.

## Navigation

- **Human Documentation**: [README.md](README.md)
- **Technical Documentation**: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
- **Parent**: [../SPEC.md](../SPEC.md)

## Detailed Architecture and Implementation



### Design Principles

1. **Strict Modularity**: Each component is isolated and communicates via well-defined APIs.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implementation leverages lazy loading and intelligent caching to minimize resource overhead.
3. **Error Resilience**: Robust exception handling ensures system stability even under unexpected conditions.
4. **Extensibility**: The architecture is designed to accommodate future enhancements without breaking existing contracts.

### Technical Implementation

The codebase utilizes modern Python features (version 3.10+) to provide a clean, type-safe API. Interaction patterns are documented in the corresponding `AGENTS.md` and `SPEC.md` files, ensuring that both human developers and automated agents can effectively utilize these capabilities.
