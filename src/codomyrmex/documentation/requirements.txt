# Documentation Module - Python Requirements

# This module uses dependencies from the root requirements.txt file, including:
# - python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# Node.js dependencies for the Docusaurus site itself are managed in `documentation/package.json`.

# If this module requires additional dependencies not in the root requirements.txt,
# they should be listed here.
