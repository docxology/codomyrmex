# Git Operations - MCP Tool Specification

This document outlines the specification for tools within the Git Operations module that are intended to be integrated with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Currently, the Git Operations module does not expose any functionalities as MCP tools.

Its primary purpose is to define project-wide Git practices (branching, commits, PRs) and potentially provide Git automation scripts for developers or CI/CD. These are typically invoked directly, not by an LLM or AI agent via MCP.

If, in the future, specific Git operations are identified as beneficial to be exposed as MCP tools (e.g., a tool to get current branch status, or list recent commits in a structured way for an agent), this document will be updated to define their specifications.

For now, this specification is N/A (Not Applicable).
