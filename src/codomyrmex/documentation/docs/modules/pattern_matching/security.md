# Security Policy for Pattern Matching

This document outlines security procedures and policies for the Pattern Matching module.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this module, please report it to us as soon as possible.
We take all security reports seriously.

**DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please email blanket@activeinference.institute with the subject line: "SECURITY Vulnerability Report: Pattern Matching - [Brief Description]".

Please include the following information in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any specific configurations or conditions required.
- Any proof-of-concept code or examples.
- The version(s) of the module affected.
- Your name and contact information (optional).

We aim to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 2-3 business days and will work with you to understand and remediate the issue. We may request additional information if needed.

Public disclosure of the vulnerability will be coordinated with you after the vulnerability has been fixed and an update is available, or after a reasonable period if a fix is not immediately possible.

## Security Updates

Security patches and updates for this module will be documented in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) and released as part of regular version updates. Critical vulnerabilities may warrant out-of-band releases.

## Scope

This security policy applies only to the `Pattern Matching` module within the Codomyrmex project. For project-wide security concerns, please refer to the main project's security policy (if available) or contact the core project maintainers.

## Best Practices for Using This Module

- Always use the latest stable version of the module and its dependencies.
- **ReDoS Prevention**: If the module allows user-supplied regular expressions, be aware of the risk of Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). 
    - Consider using a regex engine with ReDoS protection or timeouts if processing untrusted patterns.
    - Validate or simplify complex user-supplied patterns.
    - Limit the length of input text processed by user-supplied regexes.
- **AST Parsing Security**: If using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based matching on code from untrusted sources:
    - Ensure the AST parsing library is robust and kept up-to-date against known vulnerabilities.
    - Be aware that malformed code could cause the parser to crash or consume excessive resources.
- **Semantic Matching Risks**: If semantic matching involves sending code/text to external LLMs or embedding models:
    - Ensure API keys are handled securely (as per `ai_code_editing` guidelines).
    - Be mindful of data privacy if sending sensitive code/text to third-party services.
- **Resource Limits**: Pattern matching against very large inputs or with extremely complex patterns (regex, AST queries, semantic models) can consume significant CPU and memory. Implement timeouts or resource controls at the application level if necessary.
- **Input Validation**: Validate inputs to pattern matching functions (e.g., pattern syntax, input types) to prevent errors or unexpected behavior.
- **Output Handling**: Sanitize or validate outputs if they are derived from matched content and might be displayed or used in sensitive contexts.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring access or permissions related to this module.
- Regularly review configurations and logs for suspicious activity.

Thank you for helping keep Codomyrmex and the Pattern Matching module secure.
