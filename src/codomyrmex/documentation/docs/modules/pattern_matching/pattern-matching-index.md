# Pattern Matching Module

The Pattern Matching module enables exhaustive, type-safe pattern matching across the Codomyrmex ecosystem. It provides tools for code analysis, dependency tracking, and semantic pattern recognition.

## Core Functionality

This module centers around the `run_codomyrmex_analysis.py` script, which performs repository analysis, dependency tracking, and codebase pattern identification. It leverages both syntax-based and semantic pattern matching techniques to understand and manipulate code.

## Main Features

- Repository structure indexing
- Dependency analysis
- Semantic concept search
- Text pattern matching
- Symbol reference tracking

## Getting Started

For detailed usage instructions, see:
- [API Specification](./pattern-matching-api-specification.md)
- [MCP Tool Specification](./pattern-matching-mcp-tool-specification.md)
- [Usage Examples](./pattern-matching-usage-examples.md)
