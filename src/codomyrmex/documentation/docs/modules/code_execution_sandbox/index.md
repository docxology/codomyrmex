# Code Execution Sandbox Module

## Overview

This module provides a secure environment for executing arbitrary code snippets or entire scripts. It is crucial for features like AI-generated code testing, running user-provided plugins, or executing potentially untrusted code from various parts of the Codomyrmex system. It aims to isolate execution to prevent unintended side effects on the host system or other modules.

## Key Components

- **Sandbox Environment Manager**: Sets up and tears down isolated execution environments (e.g., using Docker containers, virtual machines, or process-level sandboxing techniques like `nsjail` or `firejail`).
- **Code Executor**: Receives code, language information, and input data, then runs the code within the managed sandbox.
- **Resource Limiter**: Enforces limits on CPU, memory, execution time, and network access for sandboxed code.
- **Result Marshaller**: Captures output (stdout, stderr), return values, and any generated files from the execution and returns them in a structured format.

## Integration Points

- **Provides**:
    - A secure API/tool to execute code snippets or scripts in various languages.
    - Execution results, including output, errors, and resource usage.
    - See [API Specification](./api_specification.md) and [MCP Tool Specification](./mcp_tool_specification.md).
- **Consumes**:
    - Code to be executed.
    - Language runtime information (e.g., Python version, Node.js version).
    - (Optional) Input data or files for the executed code.

## Getting Started

(Details on how to submit code for execution.)

### Prerequisites

- Sandboxing technology (e.g., Docker) must be installed and configured (managed by `environment_setup`).
- Language runtimes to be supported within the sandbox need to be available or installable in the sandbox images.

### Configuration

- Defining supported languages and their runtime environments/images.
- Setting default resource limits.
- Configuring network access policies for sandboxed code.
