# Codomyrmex Project Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the Codomyrmex project architecture. The project is designed to be modular, allowing for independent development and functionality of its various components while ensuring they can interoperate effectively.

## Core Philosophy

-   **Modularity**: Each distinct area of functionality (e.g., AI code editing, data visualization, static analysis) is encapsulated within its own module.
-   **Extensibility**: New modules can be added to the system with relative ease by following a defined template and set of conventions.
-   **Interoperability**: Modules can communicate and share data/functionality through well-defined interfaces, primarily the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI agent interactions and Python APIs for programmatic use.
-   **Consistency**: Standardized documentation, testing practices, and development guidelines are applied across all modules.

### Modules

Each module is a self-contained unit focusing on a specific domain. It typically includes:
-   Core logic (Python code, scripts, etc.).
-   Its own `README.md`, `API_SPECIFICATION.md`, `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md`.
-   A `docs/` directory for `technical_overview.md` and tutorials.
-   A `tests/` directory for unit and integration tests.
-   A `requirements.txt` for module-specific dependencies.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The MCP serves as the primary communication backbone for interactions involving AI models or agents. It allows different modules to expose their functionalities as "tools" that can be invoked by an AI model or an orchestrator. The `model_context_protocol` module defines the standards for these tool specifications and message formats.

### Python APIs

Modules also expose Python APIs for direct programmatic use by other modules or by external scripts and applications. These APIs are defined in each module's `API_SPECIFICATION.md`.

### Shared Utility Modules

-   **`logging_monitoring`**: Provides a standardized framework for logging across all modules.
-   **`environment_setup`**: Offers tools and guidance for setting up development and execution environments.
-   **`model_context_protocol`**: Defines the MCP itself, including schemas and validation logic.

### Orchestration (Conceptual)

While not a single, monolithic component, the concept of a "Core Orchestrator" represents the higher-level logic (which could be within an IDE extension, a central agent, or a user-driven script) that leverages MCP tools and Python APIs from various modules to achieve complex tasks.

## Communication Flow

1.  **User/Agent Initiates Action**: A user interacts with a Codomyrmex interface, or an AI agent decides to perform an action.
2.  **MCP Invocation (if AI involved)**: If the action involves an AI-driven tool, an MCP request is formulated and sent to the relevant module that provides the tool.
3.  **Python API Call (programmatic)**: For direct module-to-module interaction or scripting, Python functions from a module's API are called directly.
4.  **Module Executes Logic**: The target module processes the request, performs its operations (potentially interacting with other modules via their APIs), and utilizes shared services like logging.
5.  **Response**: The module returns a result, either as an MCP response or a Python return value.
