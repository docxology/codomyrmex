# Welcome to Codomyrmex

**Codomyrmex** is a modular and extensible coding workspace designed to enhance developer productivity through intelligent tools and seamless integration of AI capabilities.

This documentation provides comprehensive information about the Codomyrmex project, its architecture, individual modules, and guides for users, developers, and contributors.

## Getting Started

-   **New to Codomyrmex?** Start with the [Project Overview](./project/) to understand its goals and structure.
-   **Ready to install?** Head over to the [Environment Setup](./development/environment-setup.md) guide.
-   **Want to contribute?** Check out our [Contributing Guidelines](./project/contributing.md).

## Explore the Modules

Codomyrmex is composed of several specialized modules. Dive into their specific documentation to learn more:

[Browse Modules](./modules/)

Use the sidebar navigation to explore all available documentation sections.

Codomyrmex is designed from the ground up to be a modular, scalable infrastructure for AI-driven development. It provides the foundation for building autonomous agents, automated code analysis pipelines, and complex spatial modeling environments.

This documentation serves as a central knowledge hub for:
- **Core Developers**: Building and maintaining the Codomyrmex engine.
- **Module Authors**: Creating specialized extensions for the platform.
- **Users**: Utilizing the platform's CLI and API for their development workflows.

The documentation is organized logically to reflect the layered architecture of the platform, moving from foundational services to core execution environments and finally to specialized service layers.

## Navigating the Documentation

Use the sidebar on the left to navigate through the different sections:

- **Project Overview**: Information about contributing to Codomyrmex, our code of conduct, and licensing.
- **Modules**: Detailed documentation for each individual module within the Codomyrmex ecosystem. Each module section typically includes:
    - An overview (`README.md`)
