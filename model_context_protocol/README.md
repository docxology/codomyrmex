# Model Context Protocol

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) module defines the standardized structures and schemas for communication between AI models, tools, and other components within the Codomyrmex ecosystem. Its primary purpose is to ensure interoperability and a common understanding of data exchanged, including inputs to models, outputs from tools, and contextual information. This module provides the foundational specifications for how various parts of the system interact, particularly for tool use and information exchange with AI agents.

## Key Components

- **Schema Definitions**: Core data structures and message formats (e.g., defined using JSON Schema, Protocol Buffers, or Pydantic models) that specify the contract for tool requests, responses, and contextual information exchange.
- **Serialization/Deserialization Utilities**: (If applicable and provided by this module) Libraries or helper functions for converting protocol messages between their in-memory representation and a transmittable format (e.g., JSON strings).
- **Validation Logic**: Mechanisms or libraries (e.g., `jsonschema` as listed in this module's `requirements.txt`) used to validate messages against the defined schemas, ensuring compliance with the protocol. This module may provide example validators or recommend tools.
- **Versioning Strategy**: Documentation and mechanisms outlining how the protocol itself is versioned to manage changes and maintain backward compatibility.
- **`MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` Meta-Specification**: The guidelines within this module (specifically in its own `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`) that instruct other modules on how to define their own tool specifications.
- **Canonical Tool Specification Template**: The actual template file (located in `template/module_template/MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`) that modules should use as a starting point for their `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`.

## Integration Points

This module is foundational and defines how other modules interact with AI agents and tools:

- **Provides:**
    - **The Model Context Protocol**: A set of standards, schema definitions (e.g., JSON Schema for tool calls), and interaction patterns for communication between AI models/agents and various tools within Codomyrmex.
    - **`MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` Meta-Specification**: Guidelines and a canonical template (`template/module_template/MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`) that all other modules use to define their own tool interfaces for MCP compatibility.
    - **Standardization**: Enforces a common way for modules to expose their functionalities as tools consumable by AI agents.

- **Consumes:**
    - **`logging_monitoring` module**: For any logging performed by potential example implementations or utility scripts within this module (if any).
    - **Schema Validation Libraries** (e.g., `jsonschema` as listed in `model_context_protocol/requirements.txt`): Used internally if this module provides utilities for schema validation or for validating example MCP messages.
    - (Indirectly) **All other Codomyrmex modules exposing tools**: While not a direct consumption, its primary purpose is to be adopted by other modules, which then become "consumers" of the protocol's standards by adhering to its specifications.

- Refer to the [API Specification](API_SPECIFICATION.md) (if this module exposes any utilities programmatically) and its own [MCP Tool Specification](MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md) (which in this module's case, defines the meta-specification and principles for other modules) for detailed information.

## Getting Started with MCP

To understand and utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) within the Codomyrmex project, developers should:

1.  **Understand the Purpose**: Review the "Overview" section of this README and the `docs/technical_overview.md` (if available) to grasp the core concepts of MCP and the problems it aims to solve regarding AI agent and tool interaction.
2.  **Review the Meta-Specification**: Carefully read the `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` file located in *this* module's root directory. It explains the rules, expected structure, and key principles for how other modules must define their MCP tools.
3.  **Use the Canonical Template**: The primary resource for defining new tools in your own module is the template file located at `template/module_template/MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`. This template should be copied into your module and filled out according to the meta-specification guidelines.
4.  **Examine Existing Implementations**: Look at the `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` files in other Codomyrmex modules (e.g., `ai_code_editing`, `data_visualization`, `code_execution_sandbox`) to see concrete examples of how various tools are defined and documented following the MCP standard.
5.  **Schema Definitions**: Familiarize yourself with the expected JSON structures for tool calls (input arguments) and tool responses (output schema), as outlined in the canonical template and demonstrated in existing examples.

This module itself does not typically require direct "installation" or "running" in the traditional sense, as its main output is the protocol specification, guidelines, and templates for other modules to follow.

### Prerequisites for Understanding/Developing MCP Specifications

- Familiarity with JSON and ideally JSON Schema for understanding tool input/output definitions.
- General understanding of how AI models (like LLMs) interact with external tools or functions.
- For contributing to this `model_context_protocol` module itself (e.g., updating the meta-specification or templates), a Python environment with `jsonschema` (see `model_context_protocol/requirements.txt`) would be needed for any validation examples or utilities.

### Installation of this Module (Conceptual)

This module is a core part of the Codomyrmex project. Cloning the main repository makes its specifications and templates available. No module-specific installation steps are typically required to *use* the protocol specifications in other modules, beyond adhering to the defined standards.

### Configuration for this Module

No specific runtime configuration is typically required for this module, as it primarily provides specification documents and templates. Other modules implementing MCP tools will have their own configuration requirements.

## Development of the `model_context_protocol` Module Itself

Contributions to *this* module typically involve refining the protocol specifications, updating the meta-specification (`MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md` in this directory), improving the canonical tool template (`template/module_template/MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`), or adding examples and utilities related to the protocol (e.g., schema validators, example message generators).

### Code Structure

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of MCP and guidance for developers.
- `MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: The **meta-specification** defining how other modules should write their tool specs.
- `API_SPECIFICATION.md`: (Placeholder) For any Python utility functions this module might offer (e.g., a schema validator).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies like `jsonschema` if this module includes Python-based validation utilities or examples.
- `docs/`: Contains more detailed documentation about the protocol itself:
    - `technical_overview.md`: (Placeholder) Could detail the design rationale, versioning strategy, and core schema elements of MCP in more depth.
    - `tutorials/`: (Placeholder) Could offer tutorials on how to design and implement MCP-compliant tools.
- `template/module_template/MCP_TOOL_SPECIFICATION.md`: The crucial canonical template for other modules.
- `tests/`: (Placeholder) Would contain tests for any utility functions or validation logic provided by this module (e.g., testing a schema validator against example tool specs).

### Building & Testing (for this module's utilities)

- **Building**: If this module provides Python utilities (e.g., schema validation scripts), no separate build step is typically required beyond having a Python environment with dependencies from `model_context_protocol/requirements.txt` installed.
- **Testing**: If utility scripts or validation logic are part of this module:
    1.  **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r model_context_protocol/requirements.txt` (and project root `requirements.txt`).
    2.  **Run Tests**: Using `pytest` from the project root:
        ```bash
        pytest model_context_protocol/tests/
        ```
        Tests would focus on validating the functionality of any provided utilities (e.g., ensuring schema validation tools correctly identify valid/invalid MCP messages based on defined schemas).

Ensure any changes to the protocol specifications, templates, or guidelines are clearly documented and versioned appropriately (see `CHANGELOG.md` and the protocol's versioning strategy).
