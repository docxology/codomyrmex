# integration - Functional Specification

**Version**: v0.1.0 | **Status**: Active | **Last Updated**: December 2025

## Purpose

Integration test suites for the Codomyrmex repository. This directory contains comprehensive integration tests that validate cross-module interactions, end-to-end workflows, and system-level functionality with real data analysis (no mock methods).

The testing/integration directory serves as the validation layer for ensuring Codomyrmex modules work together correctly in production-like scenarios.

## Overview

Test files and validation suites for integration.
