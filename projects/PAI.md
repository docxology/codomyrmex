# Personal AI Infrastructure - Projects Context

**Directory**: `projects/`
**Status**: Active

## Overview

The `projects/` directory is a workspace for project-specific configurations and outputs. It provides isolated environments for different tasks or clients.

## AI Context

When working with projects:

1. **Isolation**: Each project subdirectory should be self-contained with its own configuration.
2. **Templates**: Use `test_project/` as a template for new projects.
3. **Outputs**: Project-specific outputs and artifacts are stored within each project directory.

## Key Subdirectories

- `test_project/`: Example project demonstrating standard structure

## Navigation

- **Parent**: [../README.md](../README.md)
- **Related**: [SPEC.md](SPEC.md)
