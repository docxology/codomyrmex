# Infomaniak Examples - PAI Context

## Personal AI Integration

These example scripts provide orchestrator interfaces for PAI agents to:

- Manage compute infrastructure with Swiss data residency
- Configure network and security policies
- Handle object storage (Swift/S3) for PAI data
- Create application credentials for automated access
- Deploy complete infrastructure stacks

## Key Capabilities

- **Compute**: Spin up instances, manage keypairs
- **Storage**: Create volumes, manage S3 buckets
- **Network**: Configure networks, security groups, load balancers
- **Identity**: Create app credentials for service automation
- **Orchestration**: Deploy Heat stacks from templates
- **Newsletter**: Campaign management, mailing lists, contact operations

## Data Residency

All resources created via these scripts are hosted in Swiss data centers:
